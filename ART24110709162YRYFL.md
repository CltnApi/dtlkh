Prime Minister Hun Manet reiterated the importance of inclusive dialogue and the implementation of ASEAN's Five-Point Consensus during a November 6 meeting with Myanmar military leader Min Aung Hlaing in China.

Manet met with Min Aung Hlaing, Chairman of Myanmar's State Administration Council, while both attended the 8th Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS) Summit in Kunming, Yunnan province, China. 

According to a social media statement by Manet, the junta leader thanked Cambodia for sharing its experiences in ending the Cambodian conflict and offering insights on resolving Myanmar’s ongoing crisis. 

The Myanmar leader also discussed his country's political situation and upcoming general elections.

Manet expressed hope that Myanmar’s crisis could be resolved through peaceful means in the near future.

Kin Phea, director of the International Relations Institute at the Royal Academy of Cambodia, noted that Cambodia has consistently supported a peaceful resolution which will allow Myanmar to restore the normalcy it enjoyed before the February 2021 military coup. 

Phea added that Manet's meeting provided Cambodia with an opportunity to share its experience in resolving political and internal conflicts through the "win-win" policy of former Prime Minister Hun Sen. 

This approach, he suggested, could potentially work in Myanmar, providing the parties involved have the will to resolve their conflicts.

He further commented that the meeting may encourage Myanmar's military leadership to adhere to the Five-Point Consensus, a crucial framework for addressing Myanmar’s issues. 

“Resolving Myanmar's issues requires engagement from all involved, especially the military, who hold power. I believe diplomatic efforts should be intensified, particularly by ASEAN's special envoy, to encourage all parties to pursue a peaceful resolution through diplomacy and dialogue,” he added.
