The environment ministry and its partners presented awards to the winners of the second edition of the Cambodian Energy Efficiency Competition (CEE Comp) on November 4. Environment ministry

Nearly 150 tonnes of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions were reduced and over 260,000 kilowatt-hours (kWh) of energy saved through the second annual Cambodia Energy Efficiency Competition (CEE Comp). 

The results of the competition, featuring participation from 39 companies and commercial buildings, were declared on Monday, November 4 at the Ministry of Environment.

COVA won the Category 1 – Building award, while Lotus Green Team took the Category 2 – Building prize and Zuellig Pharma was the winner in Category 3 – Building.

In the hotel sector, Ecole Paul Dubrule secured the Category 1 – Hotel award, while Sun and Moon Hotel won the Category 2 – Hotel prize. Several other companies were recognised with encouragement awards and certificates for Best Performance.

WWF-Cambodia, which initiated the CEE Comp, stated that over the past 12 months, the competition encouraged businesses to find innovative solutions for reducing their energy usage. It highlighted that the organisation’s sponsorship of participants from the tourism sector was an exciting addition to the 2024 contest.

“We saw inspiring progress from participants, with the best-performing hotel reducing their energy by 37.2 per cent! In total, participating businesses eliminated 149 tonnes of CO2 emissions and saved 266,000kWh of energy,” WWF-Cambodia shared in a social media post.

The ministry, in cooperation with Sevea, hosted the closing and award ceremony, supported by the Cambodia Climate Change Alliance Phase III (CCCA3).

The competition, which began in June 2023, included 18 companies and 21 commercial buildings, and aligned with the government’s Pentagonal Strategy.

The initiative contributes to implementing the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (NDC), the Long-Term Strategy for Carbon Neutrality (LTS4CN) and the comprehensive environmental sector strategy aimed at a cleaner, greener and more sustainable Cambodia.

Ministry undersecretary of state Van Monineath remarked during the event that the programme reflects the country’s commitment to achieving carbon neutrality by 2050 and contributing to climate change mitigation.

“Our goal at the environment ministry is to promote a culture of energy conservation by involving consumers through innovative and initiative-driven competitions, which also support environmental education,” he stated.

He highlighted the significance of energy efficiency in the country’s development, particularly within the commercial building sector, and encouraged more building owners and industries to participate in future competitions.

Por Nimol, undersecretary of state at the Ministry of Mines and Energy, pointed out that the pioneering programme demonstrated the government’s commitment to promoting energy efficiency through various policies and initiatives, such as the National Energy Efficiency Policy 2022–2030, which aims to reduce energy consumption by 19 per cent by 2030.

Laura Pretto, a climate change expert at UNDP/CCCA3, noted that the programme attracted active engagement from the private sector. She emphasised the crucial role played by many commercial companies and hotels that invested time and effort into reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from their buildings.

She added that increased private sector involvement is essential for securing financial resources and implementing climate change measures in the future.
