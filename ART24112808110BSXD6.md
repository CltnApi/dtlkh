Coach Pich Sophann, a prominent figure in the world of Cambodian kickboxing, has warned that his protege Pich Sambath, will need to step up his training as he prepares for a historic marathon tournament fight in a Japanese event on December 30.

Sambath will face former Japanese champion Taimu Hisai in the first round of the KO CLIMAX 2024 tournament. In another match, Japanese fighter Kanato Shomoji will face Thailand’s Lom Leesan Tiger Reon, with the winner of each fight competing for a championship belt. 

Coach Sophann, who followed the live November 27 draw of the event in Japan, expressed his confidence that Sambath has the physical and mental fortitude to meet the high standards of the tournament, a major milestone in his career.

He highlighted that this is the first time a Cambodian fighter has been invited to compete in a belt marathon event in Japan, and thus, a lot of effort is being invested to ensure the young fighter’s readiness.

“This fight is a historic opportunity for Cambodian kickboxing. We have never participated in a belt marathon in a Knockout event in Japan, so I am training Sambath to double his abilities in preparation for this important event,” he said.

In their first encounter – during a Ganzberg Kun Khmer event in Cambodia on April 25 – Sambath defeated Hisai in a hard-fought battle. 

Although the match went to three rounds, the Khmer fighter’s resilience and precision were key to his victory, as his attacks led to Hisai suffering a severe cut.

However, following the loss, Hisai regained his pride by defeating top Cambodian Chhut Serey Vannthong with a stunning backward kick at the end of the first round during the August 4 Knockout X Kun Khmer event in Japan.

In the upcoming bouts, all four contenders will fight using MMA-style gloves, which suits Pich Sambath’s fighting skills. 

Sophann believed that this format aligns perfectly with his fighter’s strengths. 

“Currently, there are no Cambodian fighters who would dare to face Sambath in MMA-style gloves. International fans and fighters also recognise the strength of his combat skills in this format,” he added.

He noted the need to ensure that Sambath is fully prepared for the challenge.

“We will push ourselves to the limit. We aim to make our supporters proud and prove to Japan that Cambodian kickboxing is capable of competing at the highest level,” he said.

Sambath, the 22-year-old rising star, also expressed his excitement for the upcoming fight and his readiness to face Hisai again.

“I am very happy to be meeting Hisai once more at the Knockout event on December 30. This time, I believe there may be something even more special in our rematch,” he said.

The historic event is set to showcase the skills of Cambodia’s Kun Khmer exponents on the global stage, and Sambath is eager to make his mark in this prestigious competition.
