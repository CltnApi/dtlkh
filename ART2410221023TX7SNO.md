Cambodian officials are currently studying the possibility of joining the "Six Countries, One Destination" visa policy. The Thai government initiative aims to facilitate cross-border travel for tourists among six regional nations.

Cambodian Minister of Tourism Huot Hak met with Thai officials Dusit Manapan and Chayika Wongnapachant, advisors to Thai foreign minister Maris Sangiampongsa, on October 21.

The _Bangkok Post_ reported today that during the meeting, Hak had "agreed" in principle to the initiative and will continue discussions with relevant Cambodian ministries, including the Ministry of Interior, before submitting the proposal to the Cambodian government for review, ahead of an upcoming visit by Thai Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra to Cambodia.

According to the report, the "Six Countries, One Destination" initiative aims to enhance economic and tourism cooperation between Thailand, Cambodia, Laos, Brunei, Malaysia and Vietnam. Thai authorities intend to use Cambodia as a pilot country before expanding the initiative to other nations.

The _Bangkok Post_ noted that Monday's meeting also included other discussions on enhancing tourism cooperation, such as public-private sector partnerships, connecting tourism destinations – especially UNESCO World Heritage Sites – and establishing flight connections between the six countries.

Both sides also discussed facilitating shared cultural festivals, such as the Khmer, Thai, and Lao New Year celebrations and Chinese New Year, through discounted accommodations and fast-track immigration services.

Top Sopheak, spokesperson for Cambodia's tourism ministry, told the _Phnom Penh Post_ today that the Thai side raised the "Six Countries, One Destination" proposal, and that Hak recognised it as a promising idea for boosting tourism.

He added that the tourism ministry looks forward to receiving a comprehensive concept note and related documents about the initiative through diplomatic channels in the very near future.

“This is a matter for the governments of both countries to decide. The relevant technical teams will study it in detail. The minister did not make any official agreement on participation, but accepted the proposal for consideration. There is no formal agreement yet on how cooperation might proceed,” Sopheak said.

“Studies are being carried out on the work that will be needed in different related sectors, and a final decision on the proposal will be made at a later time,” he added
