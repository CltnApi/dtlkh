The Takeo provincial court prosecutor has charged a husband and wife, owners of the Songhak Marina Maternity and Treatment Clinic, with multiple offenses after the death of a patient caused by an unknown injection. 

The couple admitted having disposed of the body of 41-year-old Nam Chanthou. Most shockingly, they left the woman’s three-year-old niece alone with the corpse, when they disposed of it in the undergrowth along a deserted roadside, nearly 4 km from the clinic in Takeo province.

A spokesman for the prosecutor’s office revealed that Sun Marina, 39, and her husband, Hieng Songhak, also known as Nget, 37, were operating the clinic, in Boeung Ponhea Kuk village, of Bati district’s Trapaing Krasang commune, without a license.

On November 18, Marina administered an injection to the victim, who experienced a severe reaction and passed away while still on the premises. 

Following her death, Marina and her husband admitted to transporting the victim’s body, along with her three-year-old niece, to a forested area in nearby Chambak commune, to “conceal the corpse”.

On November 21, Bati district police sent the suspects to court.

After questioning the suspects and examining the evidence, the prosecutor charged Marina with four offenses: Involuntary manslaughter, practicing medicine without a license, concealment of a corpse, and torture and cruel treatment causing severe consequences to the victim.

Her husband was charged with practicing medicine without a license, acting as an accomplice in concealing a corpse and acting as an accomplice in torture and cruel treatment causing severe consequences to the victim.

Authorities shuttered Songhak Marina Clinic on November 19.

Takeo Provincial governor Vei Samnang issued a statement the same day, condemning the couple’s inhumane actions and their disregard for medical ethics, as well as the Kingdom’s laws and regulations.

“As the leader of the Takeo provincial administration and on my own behalf, I strongly condemn these inhumane actions that violated professional ethics as medical practitioners and disregarded the laws and regulations of the Kingdom of Cambodia,” he said.

“I would also like to thank all of the citizens who have expressed their concerns about this inhumane act, which will contribute to strengthening and protecting public health for the betterment of all,” he added.
