Cambodian leaders have shared their condolences with the family of Chea Chanto, former Governor of the National Bank of Cambodia, Honorary Governor of the National Bank of Cambodia and Member of Parliament for Kampong Thom Province, who passed away at the age of 73 on October 25, due to illness.

In a letter to Chanto’s wife Khiev Sina, Prime Minister Hun Manet expressed deep sorrow over the death. He described it as the loss of an outstanding national figure who contributed greatly to Cambodia’s growth and represented the nation on the international stage. 

“Chanto’s role in shaping Cambodia’s monetary policy greatly supported the nation’s social and economic development,” he wrote.

Condolences were also paid to the family of the late governor by Senate president Hun Sen.

Khuon Sudary, president of the National Assembly, also sent condolences to Chanto’s family, acknowledging his major role in advancing Cambodia’s banking and financial sectors and his contributions to national economic growth through the strengthening of economic policy, currency and domestic currency use.

Chanto served as Governor of the National Bank of Cambodia from 1998 until 2023. He was Minister of Planning from 1986 to 1998, and received a doctoral degree in​business administration from Southern California University in the United States in 1995.
