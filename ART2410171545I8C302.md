# Cambodia’s largest mangrove forest is ‘teeming with life,’ biodiversity survey finds

A survey of biodiversity in Cambodia’s Pream Krasop Wildlife Sanctuary and Koh Kapik Ramsar site identified more than 700 unique species.

A recent deep-dive biodiversity survey in Cambodia identified hundreds of unique species swimming, flying, crawling and prowling within one of mainland Southeast Asia’s largest mangrove forests.

The abundance of animals within the Kingdom’s Pream Krasop Wildlife Sanctuary and Koh Kapik Ramsar site ranged from endangered otters and rare cats to migratory birds and unique bats. The report by Fauna & Flora and the Fishing Cat Ecological Enterprise identified more than 700 unique species, spanning several taxonomic groups, with camera traps and rapid biodiversity surveys.

“Often, mangroves are seen as a swampy, dirty place. But this report shows that they are teeming with life,” said Stefanie Rog, co-author of the report. “Mangroves are a vibrant connection between different species that live in this harsh environment. It is a fascinating world of wonder that deserves to be protected.”
