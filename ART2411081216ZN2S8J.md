Cambodia produces approximately four million tonnes of waste annually, amounting to over 10,000 tonnes per day nationwide, with Phnom Penh alone generating up to 5,000 tonnes daily.

Ministry of Environment spokesperson Khvay Atiya made these remarks during a visit to Sovannaphum, a natural organic fertiliser production enterprise, and a landfill in Pursat province on November 7.

He stated that Phnom Penh produces between 3,000 and 5,000 tonnes of waste daily. Of this, 60 per cent is food waste, 20 per cent plastic and the remaining portion includes materials such as rubber, paper and wood.

According to the ministry, the production of organic fertiliser involves extracting waste from the landfill at Tuol Mkak village in Pursat town’s Rolap commune. Since mid-April 2024, Save the Lives (Cambodia) Co Ltd has been authorised to clean, collect, transport and store solid waste across all seven communes of Pursat town. The actual production of fertiliser commenced on June 30 this year.

“Green business and investment play a crucial role in addressing climate change, boosting household and national economic income, and contributing to public health while creating green jobs for citizens,” Atiya said.

Sy Len, the owner of the enterprise, reported that the recycling of waste collected from Pursat town has produced 450 tonnes of fertiliser over the past four months.

Len stated that his company’s products improve the quality of agricultural soil, promote the regeneration of beneficial bacteria and support the growth of crops such as rice, vegetables, flowers and other plants, leading to improved yields.

Atiya praised green businesses for their contributions not only to socioeconomic development but also for reducing landfill waste through recycling and reuse, which in turn helps cut greenhouse gas emissions.

He added that due to the continuous increase in both general and plastic waste, the ministry has encouraged the public, businesspeople and the private sector to join campaigns to reduce plastic use, such as “Today I will not use plastic”.

The campaign has been successful, with participation from more than half of the country. Another campaign, “Clean Cambodia, Khmer Can Do!”, has also gained active support nationwide, encouraging people to collect and properly dispose of waste while cleaning homes, schools, pagodas and public areas, especially along streets.

The spokesperson highlighted that recycling and reusing waste, such as producing organic fertilisers, represents a form of sustainable commerce and investment, contributing to a greener future for Cambodia. He said this approach fosters an environmentally conscious mindset and promotes proper waste disposal and recycling to protect the environment.

“We urge all relevant parties, especially the private sector and the public, to support environmentally friendly products and services and to promote green businesses,” he said.

Since receiving authorisation in April, the company has been cleaning, collecting, transporting and storing solid waste in Pursat town, which has a population of over 70,000 residents, managing 28 to 30 tonnes daily. To date, more than 5,500 tonnes of waste have been collected and transported, with over 551 tonnes recycled and reused, and 88 tonnes sold as byproducts, according to the ministry.
