Over 4,000 cargo ships docked at the Phnom Penh Autonomous Port (PPAP) during the first nine months of 2024, marking an increase of more than 25% compared to the same period in 2023. In addition to cargo ships, the number of passenger vessels also increased.

In PPAP’s October 22 filing with the Cambodia Securities Exchange (CSX), the company reported that shipping activities at the port increased significantly during the interval. 

A total of 4,113 cargo vessels passed through, marking a year-on-year increase of 25.47%. The volume of containers handled reached 365,987 twenty-foot equivalent units (TEUs), an increase of 19.98%. Additionally, the port received 445 passenger boats, a rise of 26.06%, with 23,667 passengers passing through, up by 65.71%.

In September alone, a total of 453 cargo vessels passed through the port, marking a 134.72% increase compared to September 2023. The number of containers handled totalled 52,283 TEUs, up by 45.11%. Additionally, 65 passenger boats passed through, a 20.37% rise, while the number of passengers reached 2,435, reflecting an 11.09% increase.

Chea Chandara, president of the Logistics and Supply Chain Business Association (LOSCBA), told The Post on October 24 that the rise in transportation activities – whether by water, land or air – reflects improvements in the country's policies and economy.

He expressed confidence that the volume of cargo ships, containers and passengers passing through the port would continue to grow, particularly with the completion of the Funan Techo Canal.

“The Funan Techo waterway will play a key role in boosting Cambodia’s waterway transportation sector, especially by giving Cambodia greater independence in shipping its goods to its own deep-sea port in Preah Sihanouk province,” he said.

In addition to the canal, Chandara noted that the government is actively developing various other infrastructure projects to accelerate the country's economic growth.

Hong Vanak, an economist at the Royal Academy of Cambodia, noted that when the domestic economy is performing well, the demand for goods rises accordingly. He added that the Funan Techo project, once operational, would further boost growth.

“The number of ships passing through the port is sure to rise even more,” he said.

In the first nine months of 2024, the country’s total international trade reached $40.94 billion, marking a 16.4% year-on-year increase from $35.16 billion.

Exports amounted to $19.83 billion, up 17%, while imports totaled $21.1 billion, reflecting a 15.9% increase, according to the General Department of Customs and Excise (GDCE).
