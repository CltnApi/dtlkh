The ILO and the labour ministry’s National Employment Agency (NEA) co-organised this year’s National Career and Productivity Fair. ILO

The National Career and Productivity Fair, the largest of its kind in the Kingdom, returned to Phnom Penh last weekend. 

Organised by the Ministry of Labour and Vocational Training’s National Employment Agency (NEA), the International Labour Organization (ILO) and partners, including the UN, it offered more than 30,000 job opportunities to not just Cambodian youth, but also vulnerable groups, including women, persons with disabilities and ethnic minorities. 

The October 26-27 event, now in its fourteenth year, advances ongoing collaboration between the government the private sector, social and development partners, explained an ILO press release.

“Together, they aim to promote inclusive and decent work, bridge the gap between education and employment, and address the country’s skills mismatch. Through improved public employment services, the event facilitates smoother transitions from education and vocational training into the workforce in the country,” it said.

“This year’s fair attracted over 100,000 participants, ranging from recent graduates to experienced professionals. Among them, 41,422 attended on-site, while 63,267 participated online,” it added.

In alignment with the government’s 2024-28 Decent Work Country Programme (DWCP) framework, the fair aimed to support the achievement of the Kingdom’s sustainable development goals (SDGs).

“Cambodia’s projected economic growth of 6% in 2024 and 6.3% in 2025 will create more job opportunities for youth and students. I would like to thank the ILO and other partners for their close collaboration and contribution \[with the fair\]. We need to collaborate on various activities to help the government improve public employment services and achieve decent work in Cambodia,” said labour minister Heng Sour, as he addressed the opening ceremony.

Tun Sophorn, national coordinator for Cambodia, ILO Country Office for Thailand, Cambodia and Laos, also presented remarks during the event.

“This year’s fair presents us with a good opportunity to meet with representatives from corporations of all industries and sizes. It serves as an essential bridge between the demand and supply sides of the labour market. It connects young jobseekers with potential employers, helping to match talent with opportunity,” he noted.

“Through events like these, we are not only providing immediate employment prospects but are also contributing to the long-term development of a more dynamic and efficient labour market. This, in turn, benefits businesses seeking skilled labour while offering young people pathways to decent and productive jobs,” he added.

In addition to matching Cambodia's youth with job opportunities, the ILO and the NEA hosted an entrepreneurship panel discussion to facilitate knowledge sharing among developing countries on innovative approaches in entrepreneurship development, according to the release.

“The panel discussed skills and knowledge needed for success in entrepreneurship, challenges faced by young entrepreneurs and the public-private partnerships and good practices from South-East Asian countries to promote entrepreneurship through a South-South Cooperation approach, encouraging peer learning among nations facing similar development challenges,” it explained.
