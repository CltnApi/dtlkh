# Big brands urge Cambodian govt to drop independent union probe

Adidas and Puma among big brands cautioning Phnom Penh over free speech.

Big brands including Adidas and Puma are urging the Cambodian government to halt investigations into an independent union and drop a criminal complaint against its leader, which they say could be perceived as restricting civil society space.

Eighteen brands, all members of the American Apparel and Footwear Association (AAFA), made it clear they were concerned about labor rights group, Center for Alliance of Labor and Human Rights (CENTRAL), which has been targeted for investigation by local authorities.

CENTRAL came under heavy attack after it released a report titled “Barriers to Representation: Freedom of Association in Cambodia,” on June 4. Rights groups have accused the government of Prime Minister Hun Manet of conducting a smear campaign.
