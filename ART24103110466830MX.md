A national dialogue on social protections for the members of two specific agricultural industries was held today in Phnom Penh.

Organised by Oxfam and _FAIR for ALL_ partners, the “Better Protection for Workers and Farmers in the Rubber and Banana Value Chains” national dialogue aimed to celebrate achievements and showcase best practices by key stakeholders from the government and private sectors in protecting farmers and workers.

According to a joint press release, it also facilitated on-going discussions to identify collaborative solutions for remaining challenges. 

The event drew approximately 130 attendees, including government officials and representatives from the private sector, workers, farmers, civil society organisations and other development partners.

In the agro-industrial sector, some rubber and banana workers have accessed social protection schemes, particularly the National Social Security Fund (NSSF), which offers various benefits. However, both the quantity and quality of these benefits remain limited. Workers’ residences and workspaces are located in remote areas, sometimes lacking telephone service. Additionally, they are directly exposed to pesticides, which can be harmful to health if not used properly, along with adequate clothing, and protective equipment,” explained Oxfam national director Phean Sophorn.

Sin Putheary, executive director of the Cooperation Committee for Cambodia (CCC), noted that, as a membership-based organisation for NGOs in Cambodia with 186 members, including domestic and foreign NGOs, CCC works in partnership to promote good governance, fosters an enabling environment and ensures the sustainability of civil society organizations. 

Contributing to policy development on social protection and decent working conditions with the government is the solution to addressing developmental challenges, she added.

According to the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries, the Kingdom’s rubber exports have experienced surges in recent years.

In the first six months of 2024, exports reached a total of $229 million, making a 19.83 per cent increase compared to the same period in 2023.

“Major export destinations included Malaysia, Vietnam, Singapore and China. By 2023, Cambodia had over 400,000 hectares (407,172) of rubber plantations,” said a ministry report.

In the same period, more than 143,000 tonnes of bananas were exported, earning over $96 million – a decrease of over 20 per cent compared to the same period last year. The decline was attributed to climate change. 

Most of Cambodia's bananas are exported to Vietnam, Thailand, China, South Korea and the EU. The Kingdom had over 16,000 hectares of banana plantations and more than 11,000 hectares of harvested land in 2022, primarily Ratanakiri, Kratie, Stung Treng, Kampot, Kampong Cham and Kampong Speu provinces.

Bou Vorsak, executive director of NatureLife Cambodia, explained the position of his NGO, which is focused on conservation work.

”NatureLife Cambodia is working to support two community forests in Ratanakiri to reduce conflicts with banana and rubber companies. We encourage all stakeholders in the banana and rubber value chains to strengthen communication and seek solutions to disputes, ensuring that the growth of these industrial crops is mutually beneficial for all,” he said.

Seng Reasey, executive director of SILAKA, highlighted the importance of involving all stakeholders in the conversation.

“Women workers and farmers play an important role in the agricultural value chain, so this multi-stakeholder dialogue on social protection is crucial for finding shared solutions that ensure their lives are lived with dignity,” she added.

The joint press release noted that national dialogue was organised under the _FAIR for ALL_ project by Oxfam, in collaboration with project partners including SILAKA, Farmer and Nature Net (FNN), NatureLife Cambodia (NLC), the Cambodian Agricultural Workers Federation (CAWF), Transparency International Cambodia (TIC), the Cooperation Committee for Cambodia (CCC) and the NGO Forum on Cambodia (NGOF).

The _FAIR for ALL_ (F4A) global project, launched in January 2021 and set to conclude in December 2025, operates across 17 countries and regions. In Cambodia, the project focuses on promoting effective collaboration in social, environmental and responsible investment within the agro-industry, bananas and rubber.
