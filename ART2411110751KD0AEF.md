Police officers are currently searching for the driver of a Vietnamese-plated truck which struck and killed five people in a tragic collision on Friday, November 8. The incident occurred in Kratie province’s Chrab village, in Snuol district’s Pi Thnou commune.

The accident, between a heavy truck and a motorcycle which was carrying five people, took place on National Road 74 near the Trapeang Sre international border gate and the UBE Snuol Special Economic Zone at around 8.00pm. All five of the victims, aged 18 to just four years old, died at the scene.

According to the National Police, officers responded rapidly to urgent reports from the public, but the vehicle – which was unidentified at the time – had already left the scene.

“The vehicle was travelling from east to west when it collided with a motorcycle heading in the opposite direction, killing five people instantly. The cause was high-speed driving without proper caution,” said a police statement.

Local police, with the cooperation of border area authorities, conducted an investigation, including reviewing security camera footage, to locate the vehicle. Authorities identified it and found it parked in a rubber plantation in Krahnoung Senchey commune, Snuol district, on November 9.

A local official reported that the vehicle was a Fuso truck with the Vietnamese license plate number 92C 157.48. However, the driver has not yet been identified, and the police could not confirm whether he is a Vietnamese national.

Snuol district Police Chief Chan Sokim acknowledged that the driver has yet not been found, but said the police are working diligently to conduct a thorough investigation.

 “The victims’ families are currently busy with funeral arrangements for their children, and the police are now processing legal procedures as quickly as possible to avoid delays. Our officers are very busy with this work,” he said.

Deputy district Police Chief Kim Chhay Leang, in charge of traffic, explained that they are building a case file to send to the provincial court for legal resolution, as this is a serious incident. However, he could not specify when the case file would be submitted and declined to comment further on the case.

“The case is big one and it is not solved yet. I am building relevant documents to send to the court,” he said, while declining to elaborate. 

According to a local authority official, the five victims were all related. Sreynich, 18, was driving the motorcycle, carrying her younger sister, Sreynut, 16. The three other passengers were the girls’ cousins: two boys aged 8 and 6, and their 4-year-old sister.

He explained that the mother of the 4-year-old girl worked in the special economic zone. The girl had been crying and could not be comforted, so Sreynich was taking her to meet her mother.

“Unfortunately, the motorcycle was struck by the vehicle from Vietnam on the way to meet the girl’s mother, resulting in their deaths at the scene,” he said.
