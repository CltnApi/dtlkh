Over 100 out of more than 500 species of wildlife in the Central Cardamom Mountains have been documented by camera traps, which span over 400,000 hectares of woodland. The study highlights the area as a "vital sanctuary" for wildlife and endangered species in Cambodia, according to a joint press release on October 30.

The press release, issued by the Ministry of Environment, the US Agency for International Development (USAID), Conservation International (CI) and partners, stated that the first-ever camera trap study in the mountain range recorded 108 species.

Among these, 23 are classified as at-risk (vulnerable or higher) on the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List, emphasising the region's importance as a global stronghold for biodiversity and rare and threatened species.

The study documented 65 bird species, 38 mammal species and five reptile species, including the endangered dhole (_Cuon alpinus_), one of the country’s last remaining predators, along with an abundant prey base such as wild pig (_Sus scrofa_) and northern red muntjac (_Muntiacus vaginalis_).

Other rare and elusive species detected include the Asian elephant (_Elephas maximus_), clouded leopard (_Neofelis nebulosa_), marbled cat (_Pardofelis marmorata_), Asiatic golden cat (_Catopuma temminckii_), sun bear (_Helarctos malayanus_) and Asiatic black bear (_Ursus thibetanus_).

The record was achieved by deploying 147 camera traps, which captured 55,000 video clips and 22,200 images. The systematic deployment of these devices provided a comprehensive dataset from February to December 2023.

The Central Cardamom Mountains cover 401,310 hectares across Kampong Speu, Pursat and Koh Kong provinces.

According to the study, over 95 per cent of the forests there remain intact, making it one of the country’s least deforested areas.

Recognised as one of the Global 200 ecoregions, the Central Cardamom Mountains are home to nearly 4,000 Chorng and Por indigenous people, support more than 500 species and store a significant volume of carbon.

They also provide a critical watershed for more than 30,000 people downstream, sustaining agriculture and fisheries, including Tonle Sap Lake, one of the world's largest inland fisheries.

"The Central Cardamom Mountains face threats from illegal logging, forest clearing for agriculture, poaching and the unsustainable overuse of natural resources, such as wood collection for charcoal, overfishing and sand dredging," the report stated.

CI Cambodia research lead Thaung Ret noted that the survey confirms the Central Cardamoms as a globally significant biodiversity hotspot and conservation priority.

“While the 108 species recorded by the camera traps are impressive, they represent just a fraction of the animals present. These cameras couldn't capture insects, birds in canopy habitats or aquatic species like amphibians and fish,” she explained.

She added that extensive research is required to fully understand the richness of species and adequately conserve this biodiversity hotspot.

Environment minister Eang Sophalleth emphasised the importance of collaborative conservation efforts to protect the habitat.

He stated that the survey’s results reaffirm that Cambodian forests are not merely a landscape but a crucial sanctuary for the planet's diverse species. He attributed these positive results to the ministry’s Circular Strategy on Environment 2023-2028, which focuses on biodiversity protection and habitat restoration.

The findings also underscore the importance of collaborative efforts, essential to the government’s Pentagonal Strategy and the country’s commitment under the Convention on Biological Diversity.

“Protecting our biodiversity is not just an obligation; it is a testament to our dedication to sustainable development and environmental stewardship,” he said in the press release.

The survey was the result of a collaborative effort between the government, USAID, Legacy Landscapes Fund (LLF), Procter & Gamble Co (P&G), CI, indigenous peoples, local communities and other partners.

CI country director Sony Oum stated that the study provides a crucial baseline for future wildlife population monitoring and underscores the area’s critical conservation needs. He said CI actively collaborates with all stakeholders to develop long-term, effective conservation strategies for the Central Cardamoms and its supported landscapes.

“Our approach focuses on fostering nature-positive livelihoods, building public-private partnerships and using blended financing tools to achieve impactful climate and conservation outcomes,” he stated.

USAID mission director Kerry Pelzman noted that USAID’s investment in the Central Cardamoms demonstrates its commitment to biodiversity conservation in Cambodia and acknowledges the essential role of natural systems in supporting development goals.

“USAID is proud to support programmes that protect Cambodia's natural resources and endangered species while also empowering indigenous people and local communities to enhance their livelihoods and thrive in harmony with nature,” she said.
