Minister of Health Chheang Ra has shared a public health warning about the dangers of alcohol consumption.

He explained that it can contribute to more than 200 health conditions and diseases, including cirrhosis of the liver, cancer, cardiovascular disease, diabetes and hypertension.

Speaking at the November 27 opening ceremony of a health education workshop aimed at reducing the risks of non-communicable diseases (NCD), he noted that there is no safe level of alcohol consumption, while warning that increased intake heightens health risks significantly.

“Alcohol consumption affects the brain development of young people, leading to addiction and mental health issues such as anxiety and depression. Furthermore, it impacts the economy and society, contributing to traffic accidents and incidences of domestic violence,” he stated.

Ra also identified four primary risk factors behind the rise of non-communicable diseases: unhealthy diets, physical inactivity, tobacco use and the harmful consumption of alcohol.

Speaking at the opening ceremony of a health education workshop aimed at reducing the risks of non-communicable diseases, Chheang Ra explained that drinkers are more likely to contract cirrhosis, cancer, cardiovascular disease, diabetes and hypertension. Supplied

Or Vandine, secretary of state at the Ministry of Health, drew attention to the increasing prevalence of alcohol consumption among young people during a roundtable discussion in October 2024.

She reiterated that alcohol poses health risks even in small quantities, explaining, “Alcohol is harmful to your health from the first glass, and there is no safe level of alcohol consumption because it contains ethanol.”

She stressed that ethanol, the active ingredient in alcoholic beverages, can lead to severe consequences such as addiction, nerve damage, violent behaviour, and a rise in NCDs.

According to Vandine, NCDs are no longer confined to older populations, and their incidence among younger people is rising.

“We must act together to curb NCDs. Previously, these diseases mostly affected the elderly, but now they are affecting young people,” she said.

Vandine also cautioned that, without intervention, alcohol consumption could see a sharp increase in the coming years.

“If no action is taken between 2025 and 2030, consumption will increase dramatically,” she warned.

She noted the healthcare costs, adding that alcohol-related cancers cost $283 million annually, strokes $56 million, heart attacks $22.5 million and mental health issues $48 million.

The minister urged greater grassroots efforts in disseminating knowledge about non-communicable diseases and called on the public to adopt healthier lifestyles to prevent these conditions.
