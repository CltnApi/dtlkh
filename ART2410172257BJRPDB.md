 ![](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7b3de33e-9cce-4e4c-8162-d7a50fda9757)

The Cambodia-Laos-Vietnam tripartite split signals an assertive Cambodia and the onset of a precipitous deterioration in its ties with Vietnam.

In an astounding turn of events, Cambodia has withdrawn from the Cambodia-Laos-Vietnam Development Triangle Area (CLV-DTA). The 25-year-old sub-regional framework had been in place to strengthen socio-economic, migration and defence ties between the three neighbours through interprovincial cooperation. The CLV-DTA, encompassing 13 provinces (four in Cambodia, four in Laos and five in Vietnam), was motivated by a shared desire to enable economic exchanges across the three countries’ borders.
