Cambodia's social protection system now covers more than seven million citizens, doubling its reach since 2017. The number is expected to reach 9 million in the near future, according to the National Social Protection Council (NSPC). 

This milestone was highlighted during the NSPC national conference on November 19, which showcased the achievements of the “National Social Protection Policy Framework 2016-2025”.

“The government has spent over 17.5 trillion riel \[approximately $4.3 billion\] on social protection initiatives, marking a threefold increase in funding over the past six years,” said Aun Pornmoniroth, Minister of Economy and Finance and chairman of NSPC.

He said each beneficiary receives an average budget of 4.7 million riel ($1,185) under the 46-month Covid-19 cash support programme. 

The government has allocated a total of 5.4 trillion riel ($1.36 billion) to assist over 700,000 equity cardholder families, with each family receiving an average total of $1,949, equivalent to $42 per month or $504 annually.

These efforts are credited with improving the lives of vulnerable populations and fostering long-term economic stability.

“The social protection system will be developed into a comprehensive, integrated, resilient and self-sustaining framework that supports the wellbeing of all citizens,” said Pornmoniroth.  

“It will provide protection against income insecurity and help them cope with life-cycle risks from birth to the end of life, while also ensuring additional preparedness to respond to emergencies and climate change,” he stated.

Although citizens are required to make contributions to access social protection benefits, the minister emphasised that the government will provide support for poor, vulnerable and at-risk citizens who have little or no means to contribute.

One of the most significant accomplishments is the integration of various national social assistance programmes under the National Social Assistance Program in the Family Package, introduced in April. 

The government’s social assistance programme is making a significant impact, supporting approximately 610,187 underprivileged families through targeted initiatives. 

These include cash assistance for 370,000 pregnant women and children under two years old, as well as scholarships for over 260,000 low-income students in 2024, with plans to support 450,000 by 2025. 

Additionally, aid is provided to 30,000 elderly individuals and people with disabilities, along with direct support for nearly 2,000 members of low-income families affected by HIV/AIDS. 

“These programmes ensure that no family is left behind, offering critical support to those in need, particularly for women, children and the elderly,” said Pornmoniroth.

The social security pension system, which applies to individuals covered by the country’s Labour Law, serves 1.68 million workers.

The social security healthcare system encompasses 2.53 million active members, including 1.68 million workers, 480,000 public sector employees and over 360,000 self-employed individuals and dependents of members.

Social security for occupational risks has 1.96 million active members, consisting of 1.68 million workers and 280,000 public servants.

The Health Equity Fund provides healthcare for approximately 4.8 million citizens, with the state covering the costs on their behalf.

Pornmoniroth urged provincial and municipal health departments to focus on delivering quality services, particularly to individuals using equity cards, vulnerable groups and those with NSSF cards. He emphasised the need for equal treatment to prevent public criticism.

Additionally, the school food programme, which benefits 300,000 students across 1,114 schools, and vocational training initiatives for 70,000 young people, are fostering brighter futures for the country’s next generation.

The government’s crisis response mechanisms were also lauded. During the Covid-19 pandemic, the cash support programme for poor and vulnerable families supported over 700,000 families, allocating 5.4 trillion riel ($1.36 billion) to stabilise livelihoods. 

Similarly, targeted interventions during periods of high inflation and devastating floods provided relief to over 600,000 households.

Chan Narith, undersecretary of state at the ministry and NSCP secretary-general, highlighted that the social assistance system has grown significantly, expanding from two to eight programmes. 

“This expansion has increased the number of beneficiaries from two million in 2017 to 4.8 million in 2024, with the budget rising from 93 billion riel ($23.4 million) to 1.14 trillion riel ($285 million),” said Narith.
