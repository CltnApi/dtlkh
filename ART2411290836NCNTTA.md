The tenth edition of the Japanese Film Festival gets underway in Phnom Penh today, with a slew of free screenings of some of the best movies to come out of the “Land of the Rising Sun”.

Organised by the Phnom Penh liaison office of the Japan Foundation, in collaboration with the embassy of Japan in Cambodia, the Ministry of Culture and Fine Arts and the Cambodia-Japan Cooperation Center (CJCC), the festival will run in the capital from November 29 to December 15. 

Earlier screenings were staged around the Kingdom. 

There will be a total of 27 screenings throughout the Phnom Penh festival, with 14 titles spanning genres as diverse as drama, fantasy, mystery, animation, comedy and classics being shown at cinemas across the city.

Admission to all screenings is free. 

The selected films, including several award-winning titles, offer a glimpse into Japanese life, society and culture, with the aim of fostering a deeper understanding and appreciation of Japan among Cambodian audiences.

An official “opening ceremony” will be held Major Cineplex by Smart at Aeon Mall I on December 6. It will feature a special screening of the 2023 blockbuster _Godzilla Minus One_, which won the “Best Visual Effects" award at the 96th Academy Awards

Tanaka Haruki, deputy director of The Japan Foundation’s Phnom Penh office shared some special insights into the festival's impact – and future plans – with _The Post_.

“We have started the Japanese Film Festival in Cambodia in 2015, and this is the 10th edition. We have shown about 130 titles to a total audience of 50,000. We think the art of cinema has an amazing power to bridge cultures, foster understanding and create a sense of unity,” he says.

“Through the lens of Japanese filmmakers, you'll get to explore Japan – its traditions, modern life, its people and society, and many more aspects. We hope that this festival will serve as a cultural bridge, connecting our nations even more closely,” he continues.

Tanaka goes on to explain the film selection process.

“Our festival is not only organised in Cambodia but also in 10 ASEAN countries, as well as India and Australia. Each overseas office, and our head office in Tokyo, discuss and choose titles based on marketing,” he adds.

Engaging with the Cambodian audience, especially the youth, is a key focus of the festival.

“We will be glad if the young generation of Cambodians become influencers for Japanese culture,” notes Tanaka.

Looking ahead, the festival plans to expand its reach and introduce new initiatives.

“Until 2021, we only held the festival in Phnom Penh and Siem Reap. From 2022, we added new locations, like Battambang, Kampong Cham and Sihanoukville. This year, we had Kampot as a first challenge. We would like to not only show movies but also offer training programmes for filmmakers in Cambodia, especially the younger generation,” reveals Tanaka.

Provincial film-lovers in Battambang were treated to screenings from September 6 to 8, before the festival moved to Kampot from September 20 to 22, before arriving in Siem Reap from October 25 to 27.

It also featured pre-events in Phnom Penh, including screenings at the Japan Heart Children Medical Center and the Institut Français du Cambodge in October, as well as at the CJCC from November 5 to 8.

The festival is staged with the cooperation of the Institut Français du Cambodge and is sponsored by AEON MALL (Cambodia) Co., Ltd., AEON MALL (CAMBODIA) LOGI PLUS CO., LTD., J Trust Royal Bank Plc., and the Cambodia Branch of Panasonic Asia Pacific Pte. Ltd.
