Cambodia is planning to open a consulate-general in Henan province, China to boost tourism and investment with this densely populated region of around 100 million people. Experts suggest that Cambodia should establish more consulates in China, given the strong diplomatic ties between the two nations.

During a cabinet meeting on October 25, Prime Minister Hun Manet instructed the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation to work with the Chinese embassy to set up the consulate. Manet highlighted Henan as a "key and high-potential destination" for Cambodia.

Minister of Tourism Huot Hak, who recently attended a cultural event in Henan, noted that the province's large population could present significant tourism opportunities. He aims to attract one million Chinese tourists annually from Henan and its neighbouring provinces, with expectations of further growth.

The ministry, in partnership with Chinese embassy officials, organised a "Cambodia-China Food Fair" in front of the Royal Residence in Siem Reap province from October 26-27.

At the exhibition, Hak reported that the country welcomed over 5.45 million international tourists in 2023, marking a 139.5 per cent increase from the previous year. This included 547,798 Chinese, representing a rise of 412.6 per cent. In the first eight months of 2024, Chinese arrivals reached 538,834, a 47.7 per cent year-on-year increase.

He predicted that the country could attract seven million international visitors by 2025, including over two million from China.

"The future of Cambodia’s tourism sector is closely tied to the influx of Chinese tourists and investors," Hak stated, emphasising the country’s preparedness to offer warm hospitality and excellent services to visiting Chinese.

He urged continued cooperation between the Chinese embassy and the ministry to further promote Cambodian culture, traditional cuisine and various tourist attractions across the country, as well as to facilitate direct flights with more Chinese cities.

Hong Vanak, an economist at the Royal Academy of Cambodia, recommended that the government consider opening more consulates in various Chinese provinces to boost tourism and attract increased Chinese investment.

“This move to establish a consulate in Henan is significant. Cambodia stands to gain substantial benefits from this, particularly by attracting tourism and investment from a province of 100 million people. Capturing even a small share of this market could generate significant revenue,” he said.

Vanak also suggested that the consulate should offer efficient services to avoid bureaucratic delays, provide reasonably priced visas and actively promote the country’s tourism and investment opportunities.

Additionally, he encouraged Cambodia and China, particularly Henan authorities, to collaborate on developing tourism packages between the two regions, and work with the private sector to expand cooperation through various events.
