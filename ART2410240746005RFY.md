Thai baby hippo Moo Deng is not the only animal melting our hearts.

Singapore’s four main wildlife parks – the Singapore Zoo, River Wonders, Night Safari and Bird Paradise – are home to some of the most adorable and Instagrammable creatures in the Republic.

Here are 10 cuties – not in any order of preference – that have made us go “aww”, from a penguin with a slick hairdo to a sassy capybara who loves giving people the side eye.

**1\. Bintang, the Malayan tapir**

This is Bintang, an endangered Malayan tapir who lives at the Night Safari.

The affectionate four-year-old loves receiving belly rubs and often approaches his keepers for treats, said assistant curator Sarah Goh.

Bintang – whose name means “star” in Malay – is a sensitive creature. He dislikes loud noises such as the sound of grass being pruned, added Ms Goh.

Malayan tapirs have poor eyesight and rely on their highly developed sense of smell and hearing to navigate.

Up next is Pierre, an endangered northern rockhopper penguin with the slickest hairdo.

“For a handsome penguin, he has bad hair days… where his crested features stick out in different directions,” said senior keeper Benazir Begum.

The five-year-old occasionally gets the “zoomies”, is very vocal and enjoys showing off bits of ice and pebbles which he carries around.

It is easy to spot Pierre at Bird Paradise’s Ocean Network Express Penguin Cove, as he is the only northern rockhopper penguin there.

**3\. Moe, the capybara**

You may have seen this dashing rodent up close at River Wonders.

As a wildlife ambassador, Moe the capybara makes a regular appearance at the Once Upon a River presentation featuring animals living in and near rivers.

The eight-year-old often “zones out” when receiving scratches, even taking a break from chewing if he is munching on his favourite food, said Ms Illysha Natasha, a supervisor at Mandai Wildlife Group’s Animal Behaviour and Programmes.

This tubby rodent comes with a sassy personality. “(He) may give the side eye to people he is not familiar with,” said Ms Illysha.

**4\. Radin, the Sunda pangolin**

This is Radin, a Sunda pangolin, with a shy personality and a clumsy gait.

The 10-year-old greets his keepers every morning and follows them when they visit his exhibit at the Night Safari.

Animal care officer Ade Kurniawan said Radin once fell asleep in his water bowl shortly after climbing into it and displacing all the water.

Sunda pangolins are native to Singapore; they are also the world’s most trafficked animal due to high demand for their scales and meat.

**5\. Miata, the pygmy hippo**

She shines, she glistens and she dazzles.

Miata, a three-year-old pygmy hippo, is of the same endangered species as world-famous baby hippo Moo Deng.

This glossy animal loves running around her exhibit at the Singapore Zoo when it rains.

When the moat in Miata’s exhibit turns into a muddy playground during a downpour, she can “stay so still that she resembles a fallen tree log from afar”, said keeper Shasthi Shamanan.

**6\. Susu, the Goodfellow’s tree kangaroo**

He may look like a teddy bear, but this cuddly creature is Susu, a Goodfellow’s tree kangaroo, which is an endangered species.

The calm and gentle 18-month-old can be found perched on one of his favourite spots: the highest branch in his exhibit at the Singapore Zoo.

Susu, whose name means “milk” in Malay, goes gaga over corn, sweet potato and tapioca, said his keeper Linda Gui.

**7\. Vietnamese mossy frog**

Beauty, and in this case, cuteness, is in the eye of the beholder. This amphibian with tiny spikes all over its body is known as the Vietnamese mossy frog.

Those with a disdain for frogs may be repulsed by it, but this species’ tiny frame – the females grow up to 8.9cm and the males up to 6cm – and mossy appearance lend it quite a charm.

When threatened, these frogs at the Singapore Zoo fold themselves into a ball and play dead. Me too!

**8\. Rote snake-necked turtle**

If anxiety were an animal, it would look like the rote snake-necked turtle.

The wide-eyed reptiles can be found at the Singapore Zoo, which saw its first hatching of the species in July 2023.

These turtles have a long neck which, although useful for ambushing prey, cannot be withdrawn into their shell. They tuck their heads and necks sideways towards their bodies when threatened, and emit a foul smell to deter predators.

It is one of the 25 most threatened freshwater turtle species in the world.

**9\. Great blue turaco**

The great blue turaco may be one of the prettiest birds in the animal kingdom, with its bright blue feathers and yellow and red beak.

But it is also one of the most shy and skittish birds, making it difficult to spot them at Bird Paradise.

They are not good fliers, but are adept at climbing and gliding between trees, and make loud and raucous noises which can last for several minutes.

**10\. Straw-headed bulbul**

This songbird is a straw-headed bulbul that sings with a flute-like call.

While the birds may look similar, their keepers at Bird Paradise can distinguish them by the duets they sing, said curator Elden Gabayoyo.

The straw-headed bulbul is a critically endangered species. The bird is highly sought after in the songbird trade due to its melodious call.

In 2017, Mandai Wildlife Group was the first in over a decade to successfully breed this species under human care.
