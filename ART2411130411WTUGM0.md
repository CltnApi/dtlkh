Cambodia has set the ambitious target of achieving 100 per cent sanitation coverage across rural areas by 2030, according to a November 12 message from Prime Minister Hun Manet.

As he marked the 15th anniversary of the National Day for Promoting Rural Sanitation, the prime minister emphasised the government’s commitment to improving public health and living standards in rural communities.

“As part of the seventh-mandate government’s Nation Building and Defence 2023-2028 programme, we have set the clear goal of continuing to promote the implementation of the rural water supply and sanitation action plan, aiming for 100% coverage by 2030,” he said.

As part of a comprehensive national programme, the government has officially designated November 13 as the national day.

The annual observance is intended to both raise awareness and strengthen collective efforts toward rural sanitation, which remains a critical issue for many communities across Cambodia.

Manet recognised the progress achieved so far, with over 90% of rural areas now covered by sanitation services.

“I encourage all relevant parties to continue to cooperate and pay more attention to promote and accelerate rural sanitation coverage in Cambodia,” he added.

The government’s current policies and action plans aim to meet the 2030 deadline, focusing on a range of initiatives to improve sanitation in provinces, cities, districts, communes, and villages.

Manet highlighted that 9,675 villages, 795 communes, 79 districts, 15 cities and 10 provinces – including Svay Rieng, Prey Veng, Kandal, Kampong Speu, Kampong Chhnang, Kep, Preah Sihanouk, Kampong Cham, Ratanakiri and Siem Reap – have now been declared open defecation free (ODF).

He said some provinces are undergoing further assessment to achieve “high-level defecation-free” status, underscoring the country’s focus on maintaining and enhancing sanitation standards.

Outlining a comprehensive approach to rural sanitation, Manet shared several key initiatives, including strengthened mechanisms for coordination and cooperation at both the national and sub-national levels through a technical working group on rural water supply and sanitation.

The prime minister emphasised that the Ministry of Rural Development, along with other ministries, institutions and partners, would need to work closely to meet the 100 per cent sanitation coverage goal by 2030.

To ensure sustainable progress, the government is committed to securing resources from development partners, the private sector and philanthropic sources to further expand rural sanitation services.

The prime minister highlighted the need for continuous support from these stakeholders to advance Cambodia’s sanitation goals, especially in underserved areas.

In addition, a core element of the action plan is the development of a robust data management system for tracking and evaluating the country’s rural sanitation coverage.

“The rural development ministry shall continue to pay attention to and strengthen the mechanism for compiling a data management system for rural sanitation coverage,” said Manet.

This system, he added, would provide reliable data to support future sanitation initiatives.

With climate change posing increasing challenges to infrastructure and public health, the government is exploring innovative and climate-resilient sanitation technologies.

Manet noted the importance of identifying new solutions to effectively manage faecal waste, and emphasised the government’s resolve to adopt and integrate appropriate technologies in rural areas.

Another key initiative within the government’s roadmap is the preparation of a National Strategic Plan and a National Action Plan for Rural Water Supply and Sanitation.

Phase 3 of this plan will serve as a guiding framework, setting a clear path for rural sanitation over the next decade.

The prime minister’s message also touched upon the government’s focus on vulnerable populations, including the poor, indigenous groups and people with disabilities, who often lack access to adequate sanitation services.

He urged that these communities be given priority so that they too may benefit from improved sanitation facilities.

Moreover, the government is committed to promoting good hygiene practices throughout rural areas.

“We must continue to promote handwashing with soap in public places, communities, schools and public institutions,” the prime minister added.
