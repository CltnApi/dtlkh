The governments of Laos and Myanmar have agreed on the provision of migrant workers between their two countries, as a means to strengthen their workforces.

The two sides will work more closely in formulating plans around migrant workers and at the same time enhance the friendly relations and neighbourly cooperation between Laos and Myanmar.

Under the agreement, the two parties will implement the agreed areas of cooperation concerning their workforces and will sign Memorandums of Understanding on each agreed area of cooperation.

A Memorandum of Understanding on the issue was signed on Monday by the Union Minister for Labour from Myanmar, U Myint Naung, and Laos’ Minister of Labour and Social Welfare, Mrs Baykham Khattiya.

Mrs Baykham said the agreement would serve to implement the cooperation plans stipulated by the governments of Laos and Myanmar.

Specific cooperation agreements will be made for each planned area of work, including efforts to address people working in Laos illegally, especially in the Golden Triangle Special Economic Zone.

In this regard, the two governments will require registration, recognition and verification of workers to protect their legal rights and interests.

Under the agreement, the two sides will appoint a committee to ensure the terms of the Memorandum of Understanding are fulfilled.

Speaking at the signing of the agreement, U Myint Naung highlighted the role of migrant workers as a workforce resource, saying they are participants in developing the economies and social status of their native and host countries.

The MOU between Laos and Myanmar outlines the fundamental principles and practices to be followed in bolstering cooperation between the two countries to improve workers’ skills, employment levels, social security, worker protection, and technology, he added.

During talks on Myanmar’s labour affairs and socio-economic development, the Union minister explained the priority given to State stability and development while conducting democratic transition processes in Myanmar.

He also outlined efforts to promote the agriculture, manufacturing and service sectors, enactment of the Overseas Employment Law and plans to amend the law, the first and second five-year Myanmar National Plans of Action on International Labour Migration, and the appointment of labour attachés in South Korea, Thailand, Malaysia, and Japan to assist migrant workers from Myanmar.

The two ministers also exchanged views on other areas of cooperation between their two countries.
