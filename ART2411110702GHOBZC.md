The last time Preah Khan Reach Svay Rieng (in blue) met Tiffy Army FC, on August 11, Svay Rieng gave them a 7-0 lesson in attacking football. CPL

Defending Cambodian Premier League (CPL) champions, Preah Khan Reach Svay Rieng, are gearing up for an intense battle as they travel to the Old Stadium in Phnom Penh to take on local side Tiffy Army FC. 

The match, which kicks off at 6.00pm tonight, is not only crucial for the table standings, but also marks the return of Tiffy head coach Phea Sopheaktra, who was recently cleared of disciplinary sanctions by the Cambodian Football Federation and will once again take charge of Tiffy on the field.

In the second leg of the CPL, Sopheaktra is fully aware of the formidable challenge posed by Svay Rieng, who, under coach Jose Munoz, handed Tiffy a resounding 7-0 defeat earlier this season when the two sides met at Svay Rieng’s home stadium on August 11.

Reflecting on that heavy loss, Sopheaktra shared his thoughts at a press conference on Sunday.

“We’re still carrying the burden of that heavy 7-0 defeat. That’s something we must work hard to rectify and improve,” he said.

Despite the tough season, which includes domestic and international commitments, and some injury concerns, Svay Rieng remains a powerful side. However, Sopheaktra emphasised the importance of mindset over tactics.

“Even though Svay Rieng is still one of the strongest teams, I believe the players' spirit is what matters most. With the right mentality, we can overcome any challenge,” he added.

On the other side of the pitch, coach Munoz remains cautious and respectful of Tiffy’s recent performances. Though the army side has won 4, drawn 2, and lost 4 of their last 10 outings, the team has shown signs of improvement with recent victories, including a 7-1 triumph over Kirivong Sok Sen Chey and a 3-2 win over NagaWorld in their last two games.

Munoz is fully aware that the match won’t be easy.

“We’re playing to secure another 3 points, but Tiffy is improving, and they now have a dangerous player in Josemar Balanga. Their recent form is much better, and means we will need to stay focused,” he said.

With Tiffy’s recent progress, Munoz is pushing his players to tighten their defence and focus on stopping counter-attacks. 

“Our priority is to control the game, create opportunities, and finish chances. This is our last match before the FIFA break, and we want to give our supporters a strong performance,” he added.

Despite concerns over a few key injuries and the absence of Japanese star Ryo Fujii for the match, Munoz remains confident. 

“We have a clear plan: we need to dominate possession, keep up the pressure and keep our shape defensively,” he explained.

As of now, Svay Rieng has won 6 of their last 8 matches, with 18 points, currently sitting in 5th place. Meanwhile, Phnom Penh Crown remains unbeaten, having drawn 3-3 with Visakha FC last Saturday, and currently tops the league with 31 points. 

Visakha is in second place with 25 points, while NagaWorld is in third with 21. Siem Reap’s Angkor Tiger FC sits fourth with 19 points after 10 matches.

Tonight’s clash is set to be a decisive one, as both teams look to gain vital points before the break. Will Tiffy avenge their previous defeat, or will Svay Rieng resume their path towards the title? Fans can expect a thrilling encounter with plenty at stake.
