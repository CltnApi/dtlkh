The Chaktomuk Short Film Festival (CSFF) is excited to raise the curtain on its 13th edition. For four days, from October 25-28, cinephiles will be treated to a selection of 57 local and international films, each hand-selected from 257 submissions.

The event is being staged by the Sunflower Film Alliance (SFA), an independent collective of volunteers from across Cambodia, with film interest and skills, aged between 15 and 40. 

Ahead of the official opening of the festival, the organisers held a well-attended press conference at Fable Cinema, located at The Factory, Phnom Penh, on October 21.

“As the organisers of the festival, we, at SFA, are very pleased to present these new works and from our collective and other filmmakers to the audience. No matter what background, they can participate in our annual competition and showcase their work officially with us, rather than posting these on social media,” said Than Rathana, SFA president.

“This year, the festival received a total of 259 short films, but only 57 were selected for our audience to enjoy," added Sum Sithen, SFA founder and director of the festival.

He explained that five local films and nine international entries have been selected as finalists in two separate categories, with two different juries selecting the winners.

As in previous years, the audience will be invited to vote for their favourite entry, whether a local or international production.

“This year’s opening ceremony will feature a special performance by the ‘Acting Art Academy’ and an exclusive scene from the new horror movie ‘_The Tenement_’, co-directed by Net Inrasothythep, a two-time CSFF champion in 2017 and 2019. This screening proves that our young filmmakers really have the opportunity to develop their work through our festival platform, connecting with investors and stakeholders in the film industry. The closing ceremony will show the evolution of our festival through videos and rebranding, as well as the announcement of the 2024 winners,” said Sithen.

Cheap Sovichea, deputy director of Cambodian Department of Cinema and Cultural Diffusion and director of the Cambodia Film Commission, shared his support for the festival, and offered advice to budding filmmakers.

“The Ministry of Culture and Fine Arts and the cinema department have always supported programmes and film festivals that give our young people the opportunity to develop their careers. To establish a career, Cambodian youth wishing to get involved in our film industry should start with producing three short films as their levers and springboards to other works, especially feature films,” he said, via an October 21 SFA statement.

The free screenings and events will take place across Phnom Penh, at Legend Cinema - Olympia Mall, Fable Cinema, Major Cineplex - Sorya, Cine Hub and Workspace 2/Factory Phnom Penh. Members of the public from all walks of life are encouraged to attend.

Details of the films and screening times and locations can be found on the CSFF website and social media pages.

The Sunflower Film Alliance is supported by the Sunflower Film Organization (SFO), which has been registered with the Ministry of Interior as a non-profit organisation since 2019.

The SFA is mandated to annually renew membership and leadership for greater youth empowerment. Aside from the festival, it has produced several short films and even a TV series.
