The Cambodian Watercolourist Association, in collaboration with the Asia Watercolour Painting Alliance and the Asia Art Alliance, proudly presents the “Wonder Art Exhibition” and the “16th Asia Art Alliance Special Exhibition 2024”.

The landmark event, featuring 177 captivating artworks from 82 artists representing 17 countries, was launched today at the Museum of Economy and Money’s (SOSORO) temporary exhibition hall. 

Running from today until November 10, the exhibition offers a vibrant showcase of diverse art forms, including paintings, sculptures and mixed media, each reflecting themes of technology, nature and human experience.

“All the artists’ work has a remarkable ability to challenge our perceptions of the future while celebrating the beauty of our present,” said Cambodian Watercolourist Association chairman Chong Pak Jit. “We believe that this exhibition will resonate deeply within our community, connect … countries and inspire meaningful conversations.”

Pak Jit welcomed attendees, celebrating the exhibition as a platform for cultural exchange and artistic recognition.

“The rich heritage and unique vision of Cambodian artists deserve to be celebrated and shared with the world,” he stated. “Through events like this, we provide a platform for incredible talents to shine and gain the recognition they deserve.”

He also extended gratitude to the contributing artists, acknowledging their dedication as the “heart and soul of this event”.

SOSORO co-director Blaise Kilian said during the exhibition opening that the temporary exhibition hall serves precisely the purpose they aim to promote: hosting events with people from different backgrounds who come to exhibit, visit, exchange and express art and different perspectives. 

Kilian explained that he wants the hall to be as much of a living space and hub of exchange as possible.

“I count 82 artists from 17 countries exhibiting 177 paintings, including two by our own National Bank governor, who is also an artist and very supportive of this event,” he said. “I'm very grateful that all of you have come from so many places to exhibit in Cambodia and in this museum, which is not only the youngest but also the most modern and open-minded museum in the country, where we aim to welcome everyone.”

Volunteers from the Royal University of Fine Arts helped organise the event and likely learned from it as young art students who may one day exhibit here or elsewhere.

The exhibition is open to the public from November 6-10, including Independence Day on November 9, and is expected to attract many visitors.

“I encourage the public to visit. I am sure this is yet another event that will help further develop Cambodia's cultural and artistic scene, which has been thriving over the past few years and continues to grow daily,” Kilian concluded.

Poy Chhunly is a multifaceted artist from Battambang province known for his work in animation, painting and art education.

A graduate of Phare Ponleu Selpak Visual Arts School in Battambang and École Pivaut in France, he has played a key role in nurturing the country’s art scene.

In the exhibition, Chhunly presents a piece featuring a man wearing a krama – a traditional Cambodian scarf – in an old house on the edge of a floating village.

“People in the capital and cities see a lot of cars and buildings, so houses on the remote Tonle Sap Lake are a rare sight for them. These houses are increasingly abandoned as young people tend to work in cities or migrate to neighbouring countries,” Chhunly told The Post.

“The old saying that ‘where there is water, there are fish’ no longer holds true, pushing people to leave their villages,” he added.
