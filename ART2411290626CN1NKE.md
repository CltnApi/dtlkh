This year marks the 50th anniversary of the Australian NGO Cooperation Programme (ANCP), one of Australia’s longest-running aid initiatives.

Since its inception in 1974, ANCP has grown from a modest endeavour to one that now supports approximately 60 NGOs delivering over 400 projects in 50 countries, directly benefiting nearly five million people annually.

In Cambodia, the initiative is making a substantial impact, providing AUD 7.7 million (about $5 million) this year to fund 26 Australian NGOs and their local partners. These partnerships are delivering 47 community projects across the country, which address critical issues such as education, health, agriculture and entrepreneurship, according to a November 29 press release from the Australian embassy.  

The release noted APHEDA’s efforts to reduce asbestos-related diseases and improve working conditions for women, and the Catholic humanitarian organisation Caritas’ promotion of climate-resilient agricultural practices in Ratanakkiri and Stung Treng provinces.

It highlighted that ChildFund is working to enhance learning outcomes for children with disabilities in rural Battambang, while the Fred Hollows Foundation is providing cataract surgeries and treatment for those in need.

Additionally, Marie Stopes is expanding access to high-quality sexual and reproductive health services, and WaterAid is enhancing water, sanitation and hygiene services in Kampong Chhnang hospitals.

Australian ambassador to Cambodia Derek Yip highlighted the programme’s lasting impact in Cambodia.

“Independent evaluations consistently find ANCP has an impact and reach far beyond its annual funding, and we have decades-long relationships with local organisations and communities here,” he was quoted as saying in the release.

He also praised the collaboration between Australian NGOs and their Cambodian partners, emphasising the vital role of civil society in complementing government efforts, particularly in remote and vulnerable communities.

ANCP’s approach not only delivers crucial services but also mobilises public support and voluntary contributions from the Australian community, ensuring these projects have a broad and lasting impact.

As the programme celebrates its golden anniversary, its continued support underscores Australia’s commitment to fostering sustainable development and improving livelihoods in Cambodia and beyond, according to the press release.
