# Collaborative Approach to Enhance Efforts Against Antimicrobial Resistance in Asia

**4 November 2024, Siem Reap:** Today, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the UN (FAO) launched the five-day “Joint Regional Capacity Building and Planning Meeting”, under the One FAO Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR) Framework, on November 4. 

“The UN and governments worldwide recognise antimicrobial resistance (AMR) as a serious challenge that needs solutions urgently so that antibiotics continue to protect people and animals from death and disease,” explained a same day FAO statement.

Held in Siem Reap province, the event focuses on two crucial FAO projects: the "Action to Support Implementation of Codex AMR Texts (ACT)” project, funded by South Korea, and the “FAO Fleming Fund 3” (FF3) global initiative, funded by the UK’s Fleming Fund. 

Both projects are designed to combat antimicrobial resistance within the agrifood sectors. The combined meetings aim to enable the project teams to learn from other countries’ experiences and develop work plans. 

The event brings together 65 participants representing the two FAO projects in Asian and Latin American countries, including Bangladesh, Bolivia, Cambodia, Columbia, Laos, Mongolia, Pakistan, The Philippines and Vietnam. 

Participants included delegates from the government of South Korea, as well as FAO staff from its headquarters in Rome and its regional office in Bangkok. Other stakeholders attending the meeting included feed regulators, development partners and government representatives. 

Sen Sovann, secretary of state with the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry, and Fisheries, addressed the opening ceremony.

“Over the past three years, Cambodia, through the ministry, has contributed to fighting against the spread of AMR in the framework of improving animal production, feed production, aquaculture and good practices. 

We have implemented standard operating procedures related to the handling of veterinary drugs and appropriate use, AMR surveillance, awareness raising, capacity to farmers and regulators, implementation of one health legal framework and undertaking regular vaccination and good practices in farms to arrive at better production and a better environment,” he said.

Rebekah Bell, FAO Representative in Cambodia, also spoke at the ceremony. 

“The roots of AMR lie in the misuse and overuse of antimicrobials across human, agricultural, and environmental contexts. Both the ACT and Fleming Fund projects are committed to combating this issue by raising awareness, expanding surveillance and promoting best practices.  Let's work together to safeguard the health, food security and economic prosperity of Cambodia and the surrounding region,” she added.

Thanawat Tiensin, FAO assistant director-general, emphasised through a video call the urgent need to address AMR, describing it as a "silent pandemic" affecting global health, agriculture, the environment and economies. 

He warned that immediate action is crucial to combating AMR's spread.

Tiensin highlighted FAO's upcoming 80th anniversary in 2025, which will focus on advancing agri-food systems through improved planning, innovation, and collaboration.

“Cambodia was highlighted as a model for its active involvement in both the ACT and FF3 projects. Launched in 2021, the ACT project aims to implement Codex Alimentarius standards to mitigate foodborne AMR through systematic monitoring of antimicrobial use, while the FF3 project, initiated in 2022, focuses on gathering essential data on AMR across different regions,” added the release.

“The collaborative efforts of participants in the next few days will result in actionable plans and strategies aimed at enhancing public health and agricultural practices. This meeting marks an important step toward ensuring a healthier future for the region, highlighting the importance of united efforts in combating this pressing global challenge,” he added.
