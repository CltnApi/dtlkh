WWF Cambodia have warned that the Northern red muntjac population has declined more than 60 per cent within just six years in the Mondulkiri province’s Phnom Prich Wildlife Sanctuary. WWF Cambodia

WWF Cambodia has expressed concerns over a drastic decline in the Northern red muntjac population (_Muntiacus vaginalis_), which has dropped by more than 60% within just six years in the Phnom Prich Wildlife Sanctuary in Mondulkiri province. The organisation attributed the decline primarily to the use of snares and the illegal wildlife trade.

A 2020 WWF report revealed that snares now threaten 80% of Southeast Asia's mammal species. This crisis, driven by illegal wildlife trade and rising demand for wildlife meat, is putting immense pressure on ungulate populations like the Kingdom’s muntjacs.

“Widespread hunting and snaring are jeopardising Northern red muntjac, causing their population density to decline by 64% over just six years in Cambodia’s Phnom Prich Wildlife Sanctuary,” said WWF Cambodia, via social media.

It called for an end to the consumption of wild meat and urged the public to help protect the remained number of red muntjac, along with other endangered species.

Din Bunthoeun, acting director of the Mondulkiri provincial Department of Environment, noted that the decline in the red muntjac population is also due to the loss of food sources and climate change.

“It decreases because of changes in their food sources that vary by season. The availability of their food has declined. Climate change also be impacting them, causing diseases. Additionally, poaching remains an issue,” he explained.

He noted that two "Zero Snare" campaigns have already been conducted in Mondulkiri, raising public awareness about wildlife issues. In addition, he said the enforcement of the Environmental and Natural Resources Code, implemented in June, is contributing to wildlife protection, with laws being fully enforced against offenders. However, despite the efforts of rangers, some illegal poaching still occurs, though less frequently than before.

“It still happens, but not as much as before, because the public is more aware and we have implemented the Environmental Code. We've raised awareness, and people now understand. Additionally, we’ve placed animal wildlife pictures at all restaurants discouraging the consumption of wild meat,” he said.

The Phnom Prich Wildlife Sanctuary is one of the protected areas in Mondulkiri province. They cover over one million hectares and include Keo Seima Wildlife Sanctuary, Srepok Wildlife Sanctuary, Nam Lyr Mountain and Lumphat Wildlife Sanctuary.

WWF Cambodia also highlighted declining populations of other species, including the Bengal florican, banteng and gaur.
