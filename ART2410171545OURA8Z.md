The newly elected president of the Bar Association of the Kingdom of Cambodia (BAKC) has pledged to guide the institution toward success, despite several challenges facing the legal profession, including issues with defending clients during the judicial police phase.

Saing Vannak, 49, who has been practicing law since 2006, was elected as president of the BAKC for its 15th mandate, covering 2024 to 2026. He stated that his candidacy was driven by a desire to strengthen and elevate the dignity and excellence of the legal profession, aiming for prosperity in the field.

After the election results were announced on October 16, Vannak declared, “I am committed to leading the BAKC to success, working towards prosperity under the nine-point policy I have proposed.”

Vannak highlighted that during his tenure, he would collaborate with relevant stakeholders to enhance social justice and the rule of law, accelerate reforms in the lawyers’ code of conduct to keep pace with social, economic and technological developments and ensure the protection of lawyers in their professional practice.

He also plans to promote cooperation throughout all stages of legal procedures, particularly during the judicial police phase, where controversies sometimes arise.

Additionally, he intends to expand training and capacity-building initiatives for lawyers, fostering transparency and competence in legal practice. He emphasised that only those with knowledge will be selected for the profession.

Vannak vowed to modernise and improve the management efficiency of the association in line with the evolving digital society, while enhancing collaboration with all stakeholders to strengthen the capacity of lawyers and other key principals.

Ly Chantola, outgoing president of the BAKC, underscored the institution’s achievements under his leadership. However, he acknowledged that lawyers continue to face challenges in their work.

“Despite the positive changes, recognition of lawyers’ rights during the judicial police phase in preliminary crime investigations remains a persistent challenge,” he said.

Minister of Justice Koeut Rith, who attended the announcement of the election results, praised the association’s efforts over the years, including its legal protection for the poor, provision of free legal consultations, legal education for the public and the strengthening of lawyers’ capacities, along with other related initiatives.

Rith highlighted the essential role of lawyers in the justice system, emphasising their mission to promote a society governed by the rule of law through the protection of citizens’ rights.

He noted that lawyers' roles have become increasingly vital given the complexity of modern society, particularly with the expansion of the rule of law, the growing number of legal documents and advancements in technology.

According to the minister, government financial support for legal assistance to the poor has increased annually. In 2003, the allocated budget was 200 million riel ($49,168), rising to 2,600 million riel ($639,194) in 2024, with the same amount expected in 2025.

He encouraged lawyers to continue participating in such charitable activities to further ensure justice for impoverished citizens, thereby fulfilling both their social responsibility and legal obligations.

Rith also urged lawyers to engage in the National Alternative Dispute Resolution (NADR) process, which offers an alternative to traditional courts while carrying the same authority as a court ruling.

Currently, there are only 26 full-time officials working with the NADR, but when including volunteers, the number rises to 86, of whom 33 are lawyers.
