# Sok Eysan: Law to designate 'opposition extremists' as terrorists may emerge soon

A senior Cambodian People’s Party (CPP) official has suggested that a new piece of legislation which will designate opposition activists as “terrorists” may be passed into law soon. 

Senator Sok Eysan, a CPP spokesperson, noted that “statements from the party’s leader often translate into action”, as he joined a panel discussion on “Colour Revolutions” at the Third Phnom Penh Forum, organised by the Royal Academy of Cambodia on November 27.

Last week, Hun Sen, Senate president and president of the CPP, publicly questioned whether it was time to establish a law classifying opposition groups or extremist factions as terrorists. 

His comments came amid ongoing activities by opposition groups abroad, including raising issues like the sovereignty of Koh Kut, which is currently under negotiation between Cambodia and Thailand.

Eysan noted that Hun Sen has a clear understanding of the dynamics of colour revolutions in Cambodia, citing recent allegations of plans to protest the Kingdom’s involvement in the CLV-DTA (Cambodia-Laos-Vietnam Development Triangle Area) regional cooperation framework. 

Opposition groups were reported to have attempted to organise mass protests on August 18, with the ultimate goal of toppling the government.

Interestingly, Cambodia withdrew from the cooperation, a decision which was formalised by a Royal Decree, signed by King Norodom Sihamoni last week.

The government described the withdrawal as a move to neutralise the opposition’s leverage or “disarm” the opposition group.

“A few days ago – during a visit to South Korea to attend a graduation ceremony – \[Hun Sen\] mentioned the idea of creating a law to designate outlawed opposition groups, led by convicted Sam Rainsy, as terrorist organizations,” said Eysan.

“Just recently, at the ICAPP \[International Conference of Asian Political Parties\] meeting, he raised the issue again. I believe this law could emerge very soon. Once the CPP president raises an idea, it often comes to fruition,” he added.

Am Sam Ath, operations director of human rights organization LICADHO, noted that Cambodia already has anti-terrorism laws in place. He emphasised the need to enforce them effectively.

“Before drafting any new legislation, thorough studies and reviews must be conducted to address potential gaps and criticisms. Above all, such laws must align with the Constitution and be mindful of the international standards recognised by Cambodia,” he added.
