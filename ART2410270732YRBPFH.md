As Tiv Dararith rides to Europe to raise money for Angkor Children’s Hospital, UK cyclist Tim Jones is travelling _from_ Europe and is now pedalling through the Kingdom.

Tim was not planning to use his efforts to fundraise for a cause when he set out, but when he witnessed firsthand the devastating effects of Typhoon Yagi – which killed over 800 people and destroyed upwards of 400,000 homes and schools – he became determined to use his journey for good.

He decided to raise funds for Habitat for Humanity, a charity that helps provide housing for people affected by natural disasters.

The 28-year-old electrical metering technician left his home in Hertfordshire, UK on May 16 and has since covered over 10,000 kilometres through 15 countries, experiencing a variety of landscapes and cultures, with each day offering new challenges and rewards.

Tim arrived in Phnom Penh in mid-October and sat down with _The Post_ to talk about his journey thus far. Since then, he has arrived in Siem Reap province to visit Habitat's project office, following a personal invitation from the organisation.

**The path to cycling**

Tim’s interest in cycling began with a passion for running.

“I’ve done some marathons. I got into running a while back – I used to run competitively in school,” he says.

After a few years lost to video games, he found his way back to running, which soon became a major part of his life, with Tim logging about 40 miles a week. Cycling was initially just a mode of transport, but that began to change when he moved out of his parents’ house.

“I started cycling longer distances, like biking back home on weekends to visit them,” he explains.

Tim's cycling adventure took off when he embarked on a three-week trip around New Zealand.

“It was just something I planned myself. I didn’t really know what I was doing, but I booked places to stay and mapped out the route,” he says.

However, he quickly realised that booking everything in advance wasn’t ideal as it left no room for spontaneous changes to his itinerary.

Despite the learning curve, the experience left a lasting impression on him. Reflecting on that time, Tim marvels at the people he encountered and the inspiration they offered.

“Some of the people I met in New Zealand had fully committed to the lifestyle – some had even sold everything, including their homes, to make it happen,” he recalls.

“I knew I wanted to do more after that trip, so I talked to my boss about taking a sabbatical. They gave me a year off, so I’m due back in May,” he says.

**European vacation**

Tim’s current adventure began on a ferry from Dover, UK to Calais, France. From there he rode through the picturesque French countryside, making his way to Belgium.

He pushed on, cycling north to Antwerp, Belgium and then into the Netherlands. With no fixed plan, he let the road guide him, taking time to explore and enjoy the freedom that comes with solo travel.

After leaving the Netherlands, he cycled along the Rhine River in Germany, which quickly became one of the highlights of his journey.

“Those days along the Rhine were just magical,” he says. “There were moments when I’d be cycling through small towns, with the river on one side and vineyards on the other. It felt like something out of a storybook.”

From there, he crossed into Switzerland, made a quick detour through Austria and even briefly entered Liechtenstein – though, as he admits with a laugh, he only stayed for an hour and didn’t even stop for coffee.

After looping back into Switzerland, Tim continued south, spending a month in Italy before eventually catching a ferry to Greece, where the next leg of his journey awaited.

“Italy was amazing – the food, the culture, the vibe. It was one of those places where every day felt like an adventure,” he recalls.

But Greece brought a different experience as the country suffered through its most severe heatwave on record this summer.

“It was just too hot, and after a while, the heat made it hard to enjoy the journey,” Tim reflects.

Even so, he powered through, using his lightweight gear – just a hammock and a sleeping mat – to stay flexible and keep moving.

“Every country has its own rhythm, its own feel. And cycling gives you a chance to experience that up close,” he says.

From Greece, he went through Türkiye, cycling from Istanbul towards the Black Sea coast and on into Georgia.

**The Southeast Asian leg**

Tim explains his decision to pick up riding in Southeast Asia after his time in Georgia instead of cycling through Russia.

“I had mixed feelings about travelling through Russia. With everything happening in Ukraine, I felt that going there, even as a tourist, might indirectly support the regime. Spending money there helps the economy, and I didn’t want to contribute to that, so I chose to avoid it,” he says.

He decided to fly to Vietnam, landing in Hanoi before making his way down to Ho Chi Minh City.

One of the most memorable experiences for Tim in Southeast Asia so far has been the constant curiosity from locals.

“There were days when I must’ve said ‘hello’ hundreds of times,” Tim recalls, smiling. “Especially in rural areas, people would wave, and kids would run up just to say hello. It was fun, but by the end of the day, I was exhausted from all the waving.”

He also found himself navigating through the language barrier, but as always, he managed to find ways to connect with people. In one instance, he stayed with a local family through Warm Showers, a platform that connects cyclists with hosts willing to offer a free place to stay.

“They didn’t speak much English, but their hospitality was amazing,” he says. “They fed me dinner, and the wife even invited me to say hello to her students at an English school. It was my first time being the centre of attention like that – it was intense, but a great experience.”

Cycling through unfamiliar terrain isn’t always easy, and Tim faced his share of challenges along the way.

“There were times when I didn’t know if I could keep going, especially in places like Vietnam where it was so humid,” he says. “But I found that if you approach people with a smile, they’re usually willing to help.”

“One time, I was caught in a thunderstorm, and a guy gave me a raincoat for free just so I could keep going,” he says. “It’s moments like that where you realise how generous people can be, even when you’re a total stranger. It makes you realise how much more hospitable you could be when you’re back home.”

It was small encounters like these that made the difficulties feel less daunting and more rewarding. He also noted how nighttime annoyances, like creaky roofs and loud noises, can quickly turn into positives.  

“One morning, after a rough night’s sleep, I woke up and decided to push through to the next town. The ride was tough, but the scenery made it all worth it. It’s moments like that when the journey feels truly special,” Tim recalls.

“It was a great day. I rode 114 miles \[183km\] – my longest ever. I had to stop and nap a couple of times in cafés because I was so tired. But once I got going again, I was buzzing, especially on the downhills. When you wake up to a sunrise over a misty mountain or make great progress after a storm, it’s all worth it,” he concludes.

Of course, there were also physical challenges. Carrying about 27kg of gear, Tim had to manage long distances in unpredictable conditions.

“Some people carry tents and a lot of stuff, but I like to travel light,” he explains, saying his minimal gear and carbon-frame bike allowed him to cover large distances quickly.

As he crossed into Cambodia through Ha Tien, Tim’s journey continued to surprise him.

“I wasn’t expecting much from the border towns, but they turned out to be charming in their own right,” he says.

His ride through Cambodia brought him to Phnom Penh, of course, where he initially planned to stay for just a couple of nights, but quickly found himself captivated by the city’s charm.

“I really enjoyed exploring Phnom Penh. The centre is so well-maintained, and there’s a lot of history and culture to take in,” he notes.

**Finding purpose**

Initially, it was a disaster in Vietnam that sparked the idea for his fundraiser, but he couldn’t find a specific charity tied to the event.

“Typhoon Yagi brought destruction and killed 830 people. I arrived a week afterwards in Hanoi so I saw some of the flooding and high river levels. Typhoon Soulik wasn't as severe, but still killed 29 people,” he says. “I was in Ky Long at the time so I took shelter there for three nights. That's where I made my decision to start fundraising.”

“I found that Habitat for Humanity builds homes, so it felt like a constructive kind of charity; it made sense to me,” he explains.

“Typhoon Yagi didn’t just affect people in Vietnam. Myanmar, Thailand and Laos were hit as well. It made sense to support a charity that works globally, as I’m travelling the world myself,” he says. “I like that Habitat builds homes and makes a lasting difference. It’s not just about providing immediate relief but giving people something permanent to rebuild their lives.”

The organisation, which started in the US and now has branches around the world, became the perfect fit for his global outlook.

After setting up his fundraising page, Tim was contacted by the charity itself.

“They saw that I’d already received some donations and invited me to visit their site in Siem Reap. I think it’ll be great to see their work up close – it might even motivate me to push the fundraiser more,” he said, ahead of his ride north.

His fundraiser is directly connected to Habitat for Humanity’s UK site, ensuring all donations go straight to the charity.

“It’s great because they don’t take a cut like some other platforms do. They’ve got projects all around the world where volunteers help build homes for people in need,” Tim points out.

After meeting with Habitat at their Siem Reap concession housing project in Veal village in Siem Reap town’s Sambuor commune on October 23, Tim told _The Post_ via telephone about his experience, noting that it is a full development with the homes well laid out.  

“There was a lot of rain last night, but there's a good drainage system so there was no flooding. A few homes had also set up little businesses like cafes and a mini supermarket which was good to see,” he adds.

Tim also visited other sites with homes built by volunteers, which interestingly stood next to those they replaced. He said one old home was just a shack with an earthen foundation which the owner now uses for storage. The new home stands next to it on concrete stilts to protect it from flooding. 

He also noted how cool the homes were inside, as they were designed with climate change in mind.

In the meantime, he’s thinking ahead to future plans, potentially working with his running club to boost awareness and funds once he returns home. 

“But I don’t want to make it a big, commercial thing – it’s still important that the journey stays personal,” Tim says.

“Living on the road for months has taught me a lot about what really matters,” he reflects. “I’ve been carrying everything I need on my bike for almost six months now, and it makes you realise how little you actually need to live. Back home, we’re always pushed to buy more, but out here, it’s just me, my bike and the basics. It’s liberating.”

The simplicity of life on the road has given Tim a new perspective on consumerism and materialism. 

“You really don’t need much to live,” he says. “It’s taught me to value experiences over possessions.” 

**Looking ahead**

Tim’s journey is far from over. After he finishes this leg of his journey – through Cambodia, Thailand, Malaysia and Indonesia – he’ll be flying home for Christmas. After that, he plans to head to Chile, Argentina, Uruguay and Brazil, and then perhaps to Morocco, Spain, Portugal and France.

As with the rest of his travels, Tim is embracing the unpredictability of the road.

“Every day I wake up not knowing exactly what kind of adventure I’ll face, or where I’ll sleep,” he says.

Flexibility is a key part of his travel philosophy, allowing him to make the most of whatever comes his way.

“Sometimes I aim for a place, but a thunderstorm will force me to change plans and head somewhere else.”

Though his journey is personal, Tim’s story has intrigued others.

“People always ask me, ‘Why don’t you try to monetise your trip?’” Tim says, but he prefers to keep the focus on his own enjoyment rather than making it a career.

“I follow people on Strava and Instagram who make a living from cycling, but it looks time-intensive – daily blogs, constant social media updates, even while sitting at lunch. I post on Strava daily and Instagram a few times a week, but I like to enjoy the journey without being glued to my phone.”

The balance between sharing his experiences and staying present on the road is important to him.

“If I wrote down every detail of my day, I’d never sleep – I’d be up for hours,” he jokes. Instead, he prefers to keep things flexible, jotting down a few notes when he can and leaving room for the unexpected.

Looking ahead, Tim’s focus remains on completing his journey and continuing his charity efforts, which he feels much more motivated to do after visiting Habitat for Humanity in Siem Reap and witnessing first-hand the positive work they are doing.

“I’ve already raised a few hundred pounds. I don’t want to be pushy about it though – if people can donate, that’s great,” he says. “But for now, I’m just enjoying the ride.”
