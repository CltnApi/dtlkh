The Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry, and Fisheries has signed two memorandums of understanding (MoUs) which aim to promote Cambodia's agricultural sector and enhance its potential for export to international markets.

The signing ceremony for the new agreements – with Baitang (Kampuchea) Plc (CG) and the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) – took place at the ministry’s headquarters on October 30. 

Agriculture minister Dith Tina personally oversaw the ceremony. 

He congratulated each of the national and international partners and private sector stakeholders who are involved in advancing Cambodia’s agriculture, while successfully continuing efforts to conserve the Kingdom’s precious natural resources.

Tina explained that the new MoU with Baitang represents a crucial step in stabilising rice prices in the northwest, helping to reduce costs and increase profitability for both farmers and consumers.

The minister also highlighted how modern agricultural communities which use specific seeds and technologies have access to investment capital and reliable markets, thanks to the promotion of high-quality fragrant rice varieties, which have huge potential for export to international markets.

“The agriculture ministry seeks partners with clear, shared goals, reliable technology and the willingness to collaborate to achieve positive results,” he noted.

Lim Heng, vice-president of the Cambodia Chamber of Commerce, recently told _The Post_ that the Kingdom’s agricultural sector has shown continuous positive growth, with export volumes to international markets seeing notable increases. He attributed the growth to increased investment in the sector, from both local and foreign sources.

He added that Cambodia’s agricultural sector is also seeing improvements in technology, seed selection and crop care.

“Thanks to the efforts of the government and the private sector, we know that the quantity and quality of Cambodia’s agricultural products will continue to improve,” he noted.

Acoording to the agriculture ministry, in the first half of 2024, Cambodia exported 6,135,813.12 tonnes of agricultural products to international markets, an increase of about 57.28% compared to the same period in 2023. Key exports include rice, fresh and dried cassava slices, cashews, rubber, fresh bananas, mangoes, pepper, corn, coconut oil and longan, as well as over 75 other agricultural items.

Data from the Cambodia Rice Federation (CRF) showed that between January and September 2024, rice exports reached 445,913 tonnes, earning $335.4 million. Although rice export volume decreased by 2.3% compared to the same period in 2023, revenue increased by 2.4%.
