In the heart of Steung Meanchey, one of Cambodia’s most impoverished areas, a new chapter has begun for vulnerable families and children. 

The Cambodian Children’s Fund (CCF), in partnership with World Housing, has opened the Lenkov village, a community designed to provide not just shelter but also hope, stability, and opportunity for those who need it most.

“Once you're in a world housing community the parents don't have to worry about places to sleep, finding water, food, medical care, hence it becomes much less problematic to get the child to school every day,” explained CCF founder Scott Neeson. 

“We encourage them to send the children to school, and in the community, all the other families are doing the same,” Neeson told _The Post_ after today’s November 1 ribbon-cutting ceremony, which saw 33 houses handed over to families and students.

The notorious Steung Meanchey dumpsite closed in 2009, yet the area remains a symbol of hardship, as families living in makeshift homes around the former landfill struggle with poverty and a lack of resources. 

The CCF and World Housing have stepped in to address this crisis, providing over 650 homes to families in need across Steung Meanchey and beyond, transforming the lives of more than 2,100 individuals over the last decade.

“We are delighted to collaborate with World Housing again to provide safe homes for vulnerable members of our communities,” said Lach Savy, CCF chief operating officer. 

“The Lenkov village represents hope, transformation and the promise of a better future for children and families. It is a testament to the impact that collaboration and generosity can have on communities in need.”

**US donors changing lives**

The village is named after Peter and Audie Lenkov, philanthropists whose dedication to global outreach and support for CCF has created sustainable, life-changing housing. 

The Lenkov family raised funds for the village through an event at their home in California, the US, drawing on their passion to extend philanthropy beyond borders.

Peter Lenkov, a television producer and author, attended the November 1 gifting ceremony as guest of honour.

“A home is so much more than four walls and a roof. It is safety, it is stability, it is health, and it is opportunity, he said, “With these homes, families can focus on education and employment, health and happiness.”

The homes in Lenkov Village embody traditional Khmer architecture, stilted for both style and practicality, and offer modern amenities including a private bathroom and kitchen. 

Residents also benefit from clean water and access to healthcare, support services and education for their children. 

Community facilities include a playground, library and an open classroom where young CCF leaders will teach.

For many families, Lenkov Village represents their first experience with secure, quality housing. 

One resident, “Granny” Chhun, 69, spoke emotionally about her new home. After three years living in a cramped warehouse room with her daughter and grandson, she now has a place she can call her own. 

“I am very happy to have a new home. Thank you, World Housing and CCF,” she said. “I want my grandson to have fresh air and a clean environment to grow up in. I want him to have a good life.”

In addition to the homes, CCF has created spaces for educational and community support, ensuring that residents have access to resources that help lift them out of poverty. 

With educational programs tailored for both children and adults, CCF encourages families to prioritise schooling, which increases the chances of long-term community cohesion and family stability.

“We focus on creating a stable environment where parents do not have to worry about where their next meal or clean water will come from,” Neeson said. 

“When these concerns are taken care of, parents can ensure their children attend school, bringing cohesion to the community,” he added.

Neeson’s work in Steung Meanchey began with the realisation that a safe, consistent living environment is essential for a family’s stability. 

Without access to adequate housing, families often fracture under the weight of day-to-day survival. 

By providing homes, CCF gives these families a foundation, a place to grow and flourish together.

**A legacy of partnership and philanthropy**

The Lenkov Village is one of many housing projects CCF has developed in partnership with World Housing. 

Founded over a decade ago by Stephen Dupuis’s father after a life-changing trip to Cambodia, World Housing has been an essential ally in CCF’s mission to build communities and provide homes. 

“It has been an amazing 10-year partnership with CCF. I think we've done 650 homes in partnership, and I’m looking forward to the next decade together,” Dupuis shared, during the ribbon-cutting ceremony. 

Neeson explained that the area is incredibly impoverished and a lot of the families are homeless, they can be quite dysfunctional, they've got death, there's occasionally substance abuse. When families have a home, the other things fall into place. 

“The child can attend school regularly, and the family is more likely to stay together – all family members, including the father,” Neeson told _The Post_. 

He added that the people who live are obligated to encourage their child to come to school. 

“It’s a good way to add a bit of cohesion within a community where there was none,” he said.

Neeson explains that if they are gifted one of these homes then they have done something good to deserve it. 

“We built fencing around the outside so that they have a sense of not only privacy, we want it to be aspirational,” he adds.

This is why they are built with water and all utilities, in a very clean environment.

“We want people to try and aspire to be here by and it's not difficult, just encourage the child to come to school, work with us. That's the main thing. And of course, no illegal drugs,” said Neeson. 

Over the past 10 years, 550 houses have been built in Stueng Meanchey, but more are planned.

“I think we need to have more. One reason alone is that homes last maybe 8 to 10 years, so we need to continue to provide good homes. But we need more of them,” Neeson added.

However, challenges remain. As the CCF’s Savy pointed out, the rising cost of land is a pressing issue, limiting the organisation’s ability to expand. 

Even in areas like Steung Meanchey, land prices are skyrocketing, and finding affordable, suitable land is becoming increasingly difficult.

“We can buy land, but the cost of buying land versus the number of houses we can build is challenging,” said Neeson.

He explained that World Housing, based in Vancouver, covered all the costs of the new homes. 

“We’ve been in partnerships in 11 years. They've been great,” he added.

Lenkov, who felt a personal connection to the project, shared that seeing his family name on this new village was more than an honour – it was a beginning. 

“I really feel like there’s so much more that we want to be involved in,” he said.

“For our kids to understand what it means to give back, that’s what I want our legacy to be, not just back home, but here as well,” he added.

**Changing lives through opportunity and education**

CCF’s focus on education is another transformative aspect of the housing initiative. Children who once faced daily challenges – finding food, water and a place to sleep – now have a stable environment where they can attend school consistently.

Sim Dara, a recent grade 12 graduate from Tram Kak District in Takeo province, earned a B on his exams. 

After living in a CCF community for four years, he recently moved from his previous village – where the land lease expired after 10 years – to the newly established Lenkov village. 

Dara is enjoying the comfort of his new home and expressed his gratitude for the improved living conditions.

“I plan to continue living here,” he said, adding “when I’m able, I’ll move on, so that this house can benefit the next generation”.

He hopes to secure a Trinity Scholarship and further his studies.

Yi Sokhon, a grade 8 student at Neeson Cripps Academy (NCA) from Phnom Penh's Prey Sar commune, added, "I am happy to be here. It offers everything, including water and electricity”.

Through initiatives like the “Girls to Grannies Village” and the new Lenkov village, CCF has created specialised communities which address the unique needs of vulnerable groups within Phnom Penh. 

These villages cater to single mothers, elderly community members and at-risk children, ensuring that each group receives the support it needs to thrive. 

The impact of CCF’s work in Steung Meanchey is both immediate and far-reaching. Families once isolated and struggling to survive now have a place to call home, with neighbours they can rely on and resources to help them move forward. 

As new generations grow up in these communities, the hope is that they will carry forward the spirit of generosity and collaboration embodied by CCF and its partners.

For Peter and Audie Lenkov, this project has given them more than they could have anticipated. 

“I was texting with my youngest son this morning, sharing pictures and our experience here,” Peter shared.

“Having our name on this village is more than just a name on a building – it’s a connection to this place, to these people. And maybe some people may start with philanthropy for vanity, but as long as it brings them to help, that’s what matters,” he added.
