The ASEAN member states are taking steps toward regulating artificial intelligence (AI) across the region, as highlighted during a consultative workshop, held in Phnom Penh this evening, October 17. 

The workshop, themed “Expanded ASEAN Guide on AI Governance and Ethics – Generative AI,” gathered representatives from the 10 ASEAN countries.

Khov Makara, secretary of state of the Ministry of Post and Telecommunications, addressed the gathered participants.

He explained that the event was the result of a unanimous decision by the AI Governance and Ethics Working Group under the ASEAN Digital Senior Officials Mechanism (ADGSOM). 

Cambodia, through the ministry, is embracing the regional initiative, aimed at addressing the ethical and regulatory challenges posed by AI technology.

“Artificial intelligence is not new,” Makara remarked, “but the world is turning its attention to generative AI, particularly with the rise of technologies like ChatGPT, which reached 100 million users within just two months of its release in September 2022.”

He highlighted the rapid adoption of large language models (LLMs) and multi-modal generative AI, which use "prompts" as instructions to generate text, images, sound, video and even code. 

He cited a study by McKinsey that predicts generative AI could contribute $2.6-4.4 trillion to the global economy annually by 2040, along with another study by Kearney projects, which suggested that AI could boost the gross domestic product (GDP) of ASEAN nations by up to 18% by 2030.

The focus of the workshop was the Expanded ASEAN Guide on AI Governance and Ethics, a critical document drafted by the AI Governance Working Group. 

The guide seeks to streamline the design, development and deployment of AI systems, while ensuring that they adhere to ethical standards across ASEAN.

Sam Sethserey, director general of the general department of ICT at the ministry, noted that the guide reflects the collective efforts of ASEAN countries to manage AI’s potential risks and benefits. 

"The 10 ASEAN countries have agreed to establish an Artificial Intelligence Governance Working Group," Sethserey said, explaining that the group has drafted a framework to create ethical and accountable AI systems within the region. 

Each member state is currently consulting with its respective stakeholders to gather feedback.

ASEAN's AI governance efforts are coordinated through the ADGSOM mechanism under the ASEAN Digital Ministers (ADGMIN), bringing together the ministries of each member state which is responsible for the digital sector.

“Cambodia's participation, as represented by the telecommunications ministry, reflects its proactive stance on digital governance and its role in shaping the future of AI within ASEAN,” said Sethserey. 

**Balancing Innovation and Risk**

While the economic and social benefits of AI are significant, officials stressed the need to address the risks associated with the technology. 

Deepfake fraud, cybersecurity threats and intellectual property infringement were among the major concerns discussed at the workshop.

Makara cited an alarming case in February 2024 when a Hong Kong company lost $25.6 million due to a deepfake email and video scam. 

He also referenced a deepfake video of former Singaporean Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, which falsely portrayed him discussing sensitive issues like China-US relations and the South China Sea.

“These risks are growing,” Sethserey warned, noting that AI-generated content can be easily misused for malicious purposes, from creating hyper-realistic fake videos to embedding harmful code in software. 

“In Cambodia, we stand to benefit from AI if we know how to use it properly, but without the necessary understanding, AI could have a negative impact,” he noted.

**Governance Over Management**

Makara clarified that the ASEAN approach to AI governance is focused on managing the entire AI ecosystem, rather than imposing rigid regulations. 

“Governance, in this sense, means overseeing everything from digital infrastructure and computational capabilities to model data and usage, as well as managing relationships between different actors in the AI market,” he explained.

He stressed that governance must be agile and adaptable, with the ability to evolve as AI technologies advance. 

Cambodia, through the ministry, has already established a legal framework for AI governance, integrated into its broader digital economic and social policies.

“We encourage all stakeholders – public, private, academic, and civil society – to collaborate with us to ensure that AI in Cambodia is used responsibly and for the benefit of all,” Makara urged. 

He also noted that the MPTC would continue to work closely with other ministries and institutions to explore cooperation opportunities across different sectors.
