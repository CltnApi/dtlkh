Visakha's chances of competing for the top spot in the Cambodian Premier League (CPL) have taken a hit after they were held to a 1-1 draw by NagaWorld, while Phnom Penh Crown maintained their unbeaten streak in the league, stretching their lead at the top.

Despite winning eight of their previous nine matches, Visakha could not capitalise on their momentum when they faced NagaWorld at Kampong Speu Stadium on Sunday night. NagaWorld forward, Yusuke Minagawa, gave the hosts the lead in the 34th minute, but South Korean forward Park Jungbin equalised for Visakha in the 59th, securing a draw for the team.

Visakha fans were disappointed with the result, which leaves the club eight points adrift of Crown, who remain at the top of the league with 34 points.

One day earlier, Crown earned three points from an away victory over Tiffy Army.

Unfortunately for Tiffy, their talismanic forward Josemar Balanga Agostinho – the league's top scorer – was injured and substituted in the 21st minute. 

After his departure, Phnom Penh Crown surged ahead, scoring 3 quick goals. Ogawa Yudai found the net in the 26th minute, followed by Rafael Andres Nieto Rondon in the 36th, and Jelle Joost Goselink in the 48th. The Army team managed to pull one back in the 62nd minute through Shori Murata, but it wasn’t enough, with Crown taking a 3-1 win.

Crown’s Ukrainian coach Oleg Starynskyi expressed his satisfaction with the victory, saying, “This win is extremely important as the match was very tight. We performed well with a fast-paced counterattack.”

Tiffy coach Phea Sopheaktra acknowledged how the injury to Josemar had changed the team’s plan.

“The most disappointing aspect of the game was the injury to Josemar, as it affected our strategy. Before his injury, our two central defenders had no hesitation in pushing forward, but after he left the field, the opponent's defenders were able to open up and distribute the ball to the midfield,” he explained.

In last week’s other matches, Preah Khan Reach Svay Rieng continued their strong return to form, winning 6-0 against ISI Dangkor Senchey, placing them 3rd with 22 points, level with NagaWorld. Meanwhile, forward Chan Vathanaka completed his spectacular comeback from injury to score the winning goal as Boeung Ket secured a 3-1 victory over Kirivong Sok Sen Chey, keeping Boeung Ket in 6th place with 17 points.
