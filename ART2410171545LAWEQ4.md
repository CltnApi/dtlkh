# Siamese crocodile hatchlings a ‘promising sign’ in Cambodia, but greater protection needed

Conservationists say they’re upbeat about the revival of Siamese crocodile populations, following the discovery that 60 of the critically endangered reptiles recently hatched from five nests in Cambodia.

The recent discovery of 60 Siamese crocodile hatchlings in the southwest of Cambodia has sparked hope among conservationists, with the five successful nests highlighting the resilience of the critically endangered species in the wild.

Deep within the remote Cardamom Mountains, 60 eggs were found to have successfully hatched — a discovery that Pablo Sinovas, Fauna & Flora Cambodia’s country director, called “the largest number of wild Siamese crocodile hatchlings recorded in Cambodia this century.”

Cambodia’s wild population of Siamese crocodiles (Crocodylus siamensis) was previously estimated at around 400, with the mortality rate among most crocodile species’ young at roughly 80%, Sinovas said. As such, 60 hatchlings in the wild is “a tremendous boost.”
