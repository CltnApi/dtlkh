Over 229,000 dogs were vaccinated against rabies during a two-week intensive campaign in Cambodia. Supplied

In a major public health initiative, 229,488 dogs were vaccinated against rabies during a two-week campaign that concluded on November 4.

The vaccination effort, led by UK charity Worldwide Veterinary Service (WVS) through its Mission Rabies project, was conducted in collaboration with the General Directorate of Animal Health and Production (GDAHP) and Animal Rescue Cambodia (ARC).

The campaign aligns with the country’s National Strategic Plan for Rabies Control and Elimination, which is currently in the final stages of government endorsement.

Deploying 287 vaccination teams across Phnom Penh and the provinces of Kandal and Battambang, the project marked the second large-scale rabies prevention campaign in the country, following last year’s effort that vaccinated 74,983 dogs in Phnom Penh and Kandal province.

This year’s initiative saw significant expansion, demonstrating a robust commitment to both human and animal health in Cambodia, where rabies remains a critical concern.

WVS international project manager Dr. Amy Nicole Lewis emphasised the importance of vaccination in controlling rabies.

“The lack of awareness about this deadly disease means that many bitten individuals do not receive the post-exposure treatment they need, leaving them with no chance for survival once symptoms manifest,” said Lewis. “Tragically, children are particularly vulnerable … as they are less likely to recognise the signs of rabies in dogs and are more likely to interact with or care for these animals.”

Lewis said that by achieving at least 70 percent vaccination coverage in dog populations within rabies-affected areas creates herd immunity, stopping the dogs from transmitting the disease to humans. 

She stated that through large-scale vaccination, education and rabies surveillance, countless lives can be protected, ultimately ending the deadly disease for good.

Rabies, a virus transmitted primarily through dog bites, is nearly always fatal once symptoms appear. 

According to the World Health Organization (WHO), more than 99 per cent of human rabies cases originate from dog bites, and children under 15 are particularly at risk, accounting for 40 per cent of global rabies deaths. 

In Cambodia alone, roughly 600,000 people are bitten by dogs annually, with many lacking access to necessary post-exposure treatment, heightening the importance of preventative measures like vaccination.

Mission Rabies, which began its work in Cambodia in 2019, has maintained a consistent presence, providing vaccinations, educational programmes and a 24-hour rabies surveillance team to respond to reports of suspected rabid dogs. 

The campaign also offers a rabies hotline, allowing the public to report cases and seek assistance.

In addition to vaccinations, this year’s campaign included a free dog spaying and neutering initiative hosted at the Royal University of Agriculture, where 212 animals were sterilised. 

A mobile veterinary team further provided care to 538 sick and injured animals. 

The project involved a diverse international team, with volunteers from 30 countries and support from over 210 Cambodian veterinary students, giving them hands-on experience in vaccination administration and public health outreach.

WVS CEO and founder Dr. Luke Gamble noted the impact of this year’s campaign on saving lives, especially among children.

“When we launched Mission Rabies in 2013, our goal was ambitious – to vaccinate 60,000 dogs in 30 days. Many thought it couldn’t be done, but we managed 64,000,” he said. “Ten years later, we’ve just completed our second year in Cambodia, where, remarkably, we vaccinated over 82,000 dogs by day four alone.”

During the two-week project, the teams travelled through designated vaccination areas, going door-to-door to administer the vaccines. Supplied

Gamble highlighted that this achievement is a testament to the unwavering dedication of the incredible team and a tribute to the veterinary profession, with vets and nurses from around the world pouring their energy into making a profound impact. 

He said it is no exaggeration to say the campaign will prevent around 500 children from dying of rabies over the next few years. 

“It proves that with the right strategy, energy and support, eliminating rabies is within reach. It’s a privilege to be part of this journey, and we are deeply grateful to our partners and everyone backing our mission to end human rabies deaths worldwide,” he said. 

In conjunction with the drive, education programmes were conducted to raise awareness about rabies prevention and the importance of vaccination.

These outreach activities targeted schools, workplaces and community hubs, aiming to improve understanding and reduce the risk of rabies transmission in high-risk areas.

During the two-week project, the teams travelled through designated vaccination areas, going door-to-door to administer the shots.

The charity’s “rabies app” was used to assign areas to teams and record information about each dog, providing valuable data insights to monitor the project’s progress.

In a united effort to protect human and animal lives, 287 vaccination teams worked across Phnom Penh and the provinces of Kandal and Battambang. Supplied

Mission Rabies continues to work towards its global goal of eliminating canine-mediated rabies by 2030.

Since its inception, the project has vaccinated over four million dogs and educated more than eight million children worldwide.

As rabies control efforts expand in Cambodia, the success of this year’s campaign highlights the power of collaborative action in combating this deadly disease.
