# Cambodia celebrates return of dozens of Khmer treasures from the Met and other collections

The spate of repatriations followed extensive efforts to trace and recover looted ancient artifacts, including some identified by ICIJ and linked to disgraced art dealer Douglas Latchford.

After a decades-long journey through the hands of art smugglers, dealers and collectors — including billionaires and North America’s largest museum — dozens of ancient Khmer objects have been returned home to Cambodia.

On Thursday, the country’s prime minister led a ceremony to celebrate the repatriation of 70 artifacts that were stolen during years of bloody civil war and later transferred to Western art institutions and private collectors.

In a statement, the Cambodian Ministry of Culture and Fine Arts described the return of the artifacts as akin to the return of “Khmer ancestors’ souls.”
