Conservationists and academics have condemned the trend as a ‘disaster waiting to happen’.

Tourists have sparked debate after filming themselves sprinting around a Unesco World Heritage site in Cambodia as part of the ‘Temple Run in real life’ trend.

Videos are gaining millions of views on social media of people running and jumping around the symbolic archaeological site of Angkor in Cambodia.

Angkor contains the remains of different capitals of the Khmer Empire spanning over hundreds of years and includes the famous temple complex of Angkor Wat, where tourists are visiting and filming videos recreating a popular mobile game.
