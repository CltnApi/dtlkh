Thanks to the support of the Cambodia Motor Sports Federation (CMSF), the Cambodia Off-Road Sports Club will host the first-ever international off-road vehicle racing event in the coastal province of Preah Sihanouk, from November 28 to December 1.

The event is expected to promote both motorsport and tourism in the Kingdom.

Tea Siam, CMSF vice-president and president of the off-road club, addressed a press conference at the National Olympic Committee of Cambodia headquarters on November 18.

He noted that while the federation has organised off-road races in various forests across the Kingdom before, this will be the first time a race has been hosted at a beach location. The change in venue aims to generate more publicity and contribute to the growth of tourism in the picturesque coastal province.

“Our main goal is to develop the off-road motorsport sector, to ensure that it becomes an annual event. In the future, we plan to host this event in various provinces across Cambodia, not just in Preah Sihanouk,” explained Siam.

“Sihanoukville town is a promising tourist destination, and that's why we chose this location – to promote both the sport and tourism. I believe that foreign racers will arrive early and bring media representatives, photographers and writers which will help to publicise the event even further,” he added.

Lun Bora from BM Motorsports announced that his team has prepared three vehicles that will contest the race. 

He expressed his opinion that the beach-side location will attract more attention from the public than the races which are held in mountainous regions. 

Bora was confident that his team would perform well and defend their title, as champions of last year's international off-road race.

“Last year, we secured first place in the Kirirom race, but this year, teams from various countries, especially Thailand, will be well-prepared to take the trophy from us. However, we hope to defend our title, because we train regularly and are well-prepared,” he explained.

“As a successful team, we know exactly how to adjust the vehicles to suit the drivers, because the cars and drivers work in close harmony. We’ve already set up the car systems, and our drivers have already tested the vehicles. We will do our best to protect our title and win more trophies,” he added.

In addition to the race itself, the event will feature a large camp site near the beach, with space for approximately 1,000 tents. The site will be available for four days and there will be food stalls, clean water outlets and lighting, allowing participants to enjoy the beach while attending the off-road race.

 “Camping is completely free. We just require that people register so that our team can manage the arrangements. Many participants have already signed up, and we ask that they help maintain the environment and the cleanliness of the site,” explained Sek Chandara, who is in charge of the camping arrangements.

Siam noted that approximately 60 racers, including 40 from Cambodia and 20 foreign entrants from Thailand, Laos, Vietnam and China, have registered for the race.
