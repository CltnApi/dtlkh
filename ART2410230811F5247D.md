Several students from the Cambodian Children’s Fund (CCF), an organisation that supports children from underprivileged backgrounds, are exhibiting their latest photography work in Phnom Penh, through this year’s annual edition of the ‘STEM In My Life’ exhibition. 

The event, hosted at Wild restaurant, highlights the creativity and talent of students from CCF’s Neeson Cripps Academy (NCA), through the lens of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM).

The exhibition features 10 images selected from a competition which aimed to inspire students to explore STEM concepts in their everyday lives through photography. 

The finalists represent the innovative approach CCF takes toward education, encouraging students to integrate artistic expression with scientific understanding.

“We wanted to create an opportunity for students to see STEM in a different light and challenge them to think about how science and technology influence their surroundings,” explains Phorn La, education project officer at CCF. 

“This competition has allowed students to engage their creative minds and develop a deeper appreciation for STEM subjects,” she adds.

Now in its third year, the ‘STEM In My Life’ competition asks participants to submit a photograph along with a narrative describing how their image represents an aspect of STEM. 

Among the finalists, 15-year-old Samnang’s photo, titled _Natural (Lifesaver)_, depicts a vivid pink flower growing out of stones, symbolising resilience and the natural world’s connection to science.

Another standout entry comes from 14-year-old Sokha Pich, whose striking image captures sparks from a welder that, in her eyes, formed the shape of a jellyfish. 

“I like the sea, but I have never been there. When I watch a movie, I sometimes see people dive into the ocean to see the coral reef; I want to experience it, too,” says Pich, a grade 8 NCA student.

“If you look at my picture, my purpose is to show you the imagination. I can’t believe it transformed into a jellyfish,” she adds.

Sokchea, a Grade 12 student, contributed a thought-provoking piece titled _The Downside of Virtual_, which explores the impact of online life on personal identity. 

“Technology has always fascinated me, and I wanted to show how it can sometimes overshadow real life,” says Sokchea, who aspires to pursue a career in media and communications.

The exhibition, which also celebrates CCF’s 20th anniversary, offers visitors a glimpse into the transformative journey of the organisation, from its beginnings helping children from Phnom Penh’s former Steung Meanchey garbage dump to its current role in providing education to nearly 1,700 students.

Visitors to the exhibition can vote for their favourite photograph, with awards presented based on both public votes and a judge's panel, which includes Scott Neeson, CCF founder and executive director, and Renaud Dion, co-founder of Wild restaurant.

“The exhibition not only highlights the talent of these young photographers but also reinforces the power of education to open doors for disadvantaged children,” Dion shares.

“We’re thrilled to collaborate with CCF and provide a platform for these students to showcase their work,” he continues.

The STEM In My Life photography exhibition is open to the public at Wild restaurant in Phnom Penh until 10 November, with free admission.
