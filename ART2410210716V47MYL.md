Over 30,000 people witnessed a joint performance of Kun Lbokator and Chinese Shaolin martial arts in China’s Henan province during the 13th International Shaolin Wushu Festival on October 19.

The historic event took place in front of Shaolin Temple in Henan’s Dengfeng area, recognised as the birthplace of Chinese Kung Fu, with twelve Cambodian athletes participating.

The Ministry of Tourism stated on social media on October 20: "This is an extraordinary and unprecedented event, and a source of pride for Cambodia to participate in, where martial arts performances from various countries are held at the Shaolin Temple gate."

The Lbokator performance at Shaolin Temple is a continuation of the “When Shaolin Meets Bokator” event, first held in Siem Reap province in April and now in China. The display is also part of the 2024 Cambodia-China People-to-People Exchange Year.

Previously known simply as Bokator, the ancient martial art was officially recognised by UNESCO under the name "Kun Lbokator” in 2022.

According to the ministry, the festival attracted participants from 56 countries, featuring around 1,200 athletes, tourism associations and private sector representatives. Spectators included both domestic and international tourists, along with around 30,000 students, teachers and martial arts performers.

Tourism minister Huot Hak told reporters upon his return to Cambodia on October 20 that the event was an historic moment for the country, as the Cambodian flag was raised in front of tens of thousands of attendees.

He highlighted that this demonstrated the country’s sovereignty and equal standing with other countries on the international stage.

Hak described Lbokator as an ancient Khmer martial art dating back to prehistoric times, with movements depicted on the walls of temples including Angkor Wat, Bayon, Banteay Srei, Baphuon and Sambor Prei Kuk. He noted that Lbokator is considered to predate Shaolin martial arts, which are around 1,500 years old.

Hak also revealed that during his trip to the event, he promoted Cambodia’s potential in the tourism and investment sectors while meeting with 22 Chinese companies involved in related businesses. He said the companies expressed interest in investing in Cambodia, particularly in tourism.

Chhort Bunthang, a cultural studies, education and tourism research officer at the Royal Academy of Cambodia, highlighted that it is encouraging to see cultural exchanges between Cambodia and China progressing smoothly.

He explained that the Lbokator performance, representing the country’s cultural identity and tourism offerings at an international level, helps boost global recognition of the country and Khmer identity and arts.

"Additionally, the exchange of Lbokator and Shaolin performances enhances diplomatic, economic and political relations between the two countries, especially promoting tourism in both nations," Bunthang said.

“When we have opportunities to perform abroad, it serves as a catalyst for the growth of Khmer culture. It also reflects our progress and development; without such opportunities, there would be nothing to showcase. This encourages more learners and practitioners of the martial art, providing jobs and opportunities for artists to display their talents locally and internationally, which helps preserve Khmer cultural identity and brings various benefits,” he added.
