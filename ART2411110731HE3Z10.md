The number of foreign tourists visiting Angkor Archaeological Park is projected to reach nearly 300,000 over the final two months of 2024, marking a significant boost for Cambodia’s tourism sector. 

Since early November, ticket sales for foreign visitors to Angkor have increased by approximately 50% compared to October. The Ministry of Tourism is also set to hold the "Cambodia-China Travel Fair" in Siem Reap province in December, further bolstering tourism.

**Ticket sales for foreign tourists climb to nearly 4,000 per day**

Ly Se, director-general of Angkor Enterprise, told local media on November 8 that ticket sales have surged since the beginning of November. He said 3,500-3,800 tickets are being sold daily, up from 2,500-2,600 per day in October.

Se anticipates that foreign tourist numbers for the last two months of 2024 could total between 120,000 and 140,000 per month. He said this upward trend is a promising sign of a strong recovery for Siem Reap’s tourism sector and the country as a whole. 

He added that ticket sales are expected to continue climbing in December, potentially exceeding 4,000 per day as the peak European tourist season and Cambodia’s cooler months set in.

He highlighted that the increase in foreign visitors has been accompanied by improvements in the quality of hospitality and tourism services.

Chan Mom, a 45-year-old cleaner at Angkor Wat, shared her observations with _The Post_ last week, noting a marked increase over the past few weeks. Visitors, she said, have come from a variety of countries, with many seen queuing to enter the central temple complex each morning until about 10am.

“I haven’t seen this many visitors in a long time,” she said, adding, “If this trend continues, the tourism sector in Siem Reap will recover very well.”

Mom noted that increased direct flights to Siem Reap-Angkor International Airport (SAI) and the absence of negative media coverage about Cambodia, particularly from neighbouring countries, could attract even more foreign visitors. 

The ministry reported that the country welcomed 4.8 million foreigners in the first three quarters of 2024, reflecting a 22.2% increase compared to the same period in 2023. Ticket sales for foreign visitors to Angkor Archaeological Park reached 699,850, up 29.7%, generating $32.5 million in revenue – a 30.2% rise.

Khieu Thy, president of the Khmer Angkor Tourist Guide Association (KATGA), noted that the number of foreigners visiting Siem Reap has risen significantly in recent weeks. 

In November, he said his bookings were nearly full for the entire month, with other tour guides experiencing similar demand. 

He noted that if the current surge continues through February or March 2025, it would mark a significant recovery for the sector, which has struggled since the Covid-19 pandemic began in early 2020.

Thy emphasised that the influx of tourists not only boosts national revenue but also helps promote the country’s rich culture and history, create jobs and stimulate the local economy.

“The number of foreign visitors coming to Siem Reap is currently high, with a diverse mix of nationalities,” said Thy. 

He noted that the increase is likely due to the start of the peak tourist season, which coincides with government and private sector initiatives to promote the country’s tourism internationally.

The period from October to March is generally considered the peak season for foreign tourists, particularly those from Europe and North America. The increase in international flights at SAI also reflects this growth.

**Tourism fair set for December in Siem Reap**

On November 8, the ministry announced continued efforts to boost tourism under the “Cambodia-China People-to-People Exchange Year 2024” campaign and the “Visit Siem Reap 2024” initiative. 

In collaboration with the Chinese embassy in Cambodia, relevant ministries, institutions and private sector partners, the ministry will organise the “Cambodia-China Travel Fair” from December 6-8 in Siem Reap.

The fair is expected to attract 50 Chinese buyers, 50 Chinese sellers, 100 Cambodian sellers and 50 media representatives. The event will feature promotional seminars on the country’s tourism, business matching sessions and pre- and post-event tours.

**2023 tourism statistics**

According to the latest data from the ministry, the Kingdom welcomed 5.45 million international tourists in 2023, marking a 139.5% increase compared to 2022. Domestic tourism also grew, generating $18.74 million, a rise of 34.5%. 

Revenue from international tourism climbed to $3.08 billion, marking an increase of 117.9%. The sector contributed approximately 7.5% to Cambodia’s GDP.

In comparison, 2019 was a peak year for the country’s tourism sector, with 6.61 million foreign visitors generating $4.92 billion in revenue and contributing 12.1% to the GDP.
