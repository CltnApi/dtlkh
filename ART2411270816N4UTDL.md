GROHE IGINA Shower Toilet

LIXIL, a global leader in water and housing products, is solving real-life challenges and making better homes a reality for everyone, everywhere. Its well-known global power brands – American Standard, GROHE and INAX – touch the lives of over a billion people worldwide by delivering innovative and sustainable solutions tailored to modern living. 

LIXIL is focused on understanding consumers and engaging with industry partners to address real needs and changing aspirations.

In Cambodia, rapid economic growth and a growing middle class are steadily lifting consumer expectations and driving demand for high-quality bathroom and kitchen products. The rise of premium hospitality projects and luxury residences is fuelling the need for superior living and leisure experiences. 

Reflecting this trend, GROHE has been selected for premium projects such as the Hyatt Regency, Fairfield by Marriott, Shangri-La Phnom Penh Hotel and the Citadines Flatiron Phnom Penh Hotel and Serviced Apartments.

Cambodia's architectural and design (A&D) community has a rich cultural heritage, with iconic structures like Angkor Wat reflecting deep expertise in purposeful design and craftsmanship.

GROHE Allure Basin Mixer

Today, the sector is transforming the country with modern infrastructure, luxury developments and revitalised heritage projects. Architects play a key role in this transformation, shaping the country’s future while preserving its cultural identity. They bring consumer needs and aspirations to life by designing new spaces and revitalising existing properties.

LIXIL is committed to engaging and partnering with architects and designers to realise the growing opportunities in the country. This commitment is exemplified by LIXIL’s participation in the Cambodia Architecture Gallery (CAG) 2024, a platform where A&D leaders come together to address pressing challenges faced by consumers and the property industry.

GROHE, which is part of LIXIL, is proud to be a CAG sponsor this year. At the event, GROHE will showcase premium solutions for water enjoyment while meeting diverse consumer needs.
