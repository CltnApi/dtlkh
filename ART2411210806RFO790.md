The World Bank has identified critical challenges in Cambodia’s transport sector and proposed targeted investments and policy measures to improve regional connectivity. 

In a new report, “Cambodia’s Regional Connectivity: Unlocking the Full Potential of Transport Corridors”, it suggested that the Kingdom could play an important role in promoting regional trade and connectivity, provided it enhances its transport links with neighbouring countries and embraces its vision of strengthening multimodal transport development

“Regional connectivity and logistics development are Cambodia’s top priorities; strengthening our capacities will be key,” Peng Ponea, Minister of Public Works and Transport, was quoted as saying in a November 21 World Bank press release.

“They can help position Cambodia as one of the key players in regional connectivity and boosting trade along the global supply chains,” he added.

The release explained that the seventh-mandate government developed the “Comprehensive Intermodal Transport and Logistics System (CITLS) Master Plan for 2023–2033” to improve the performance and efficiency of the transport sector and support the achievement of the national development objectives defined in phase one of its Pentagonal Strategy. 

The World Bank report provided complementary recommendations that focus on immediate investments and policy actions to unlock opportunities along key existing transport corridors in Cambodia.

“The report brought together key stakeholders from the government, the private sector and development partners to explore options to enhance Cambodia's transport sector and regional connectivity,” explained Tania Meyer, World Bank country manager for Cambodia.

“A comprehensive approach to transport network development will help improve Cambodia’s competitiveness, unlock its export potential and promote trade in the region,” she continued.

According to the release, Cambodia’s export-driven growth has resulted in increased demand to move ever-larger volumes of goods and cargo more efficiently along its transport network and across its borders. 

“The report proposes priority investments and policy actions to improve the performance of the existing road, rail and inland waterway transport. A comprehensive and coordinated approach to transport network development with a focus on climate resilience will help improve competitiveness, increase economic efficiency and promote trade in the region,” it said.
