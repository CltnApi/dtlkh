The 2021 Royal Decree regarding sentence reduction and pardon states that inmates must demonstrate genuine reformation to be eligible for pardons or sentence reductions. Post Staff

The National Commission to Review and Request Sentence Reductions and Pardons has denied appeals for 281 out of 671 incarcerated applicants due to their involvement in severe and violent criminal offenses.

The decision was reached during a November 5 meeting, led by Minister of Justice Koeut Rith, chair of the commission. The meeting evaluated the list of inmates applying for pardons or sentence reductions to be granted during the country’s Independence Day and Water Festival.

According to Rith, the inmates whose requests were denied are linked to crimes involving drugs, gang-related activities, murder, human trafficking and child molestation.

The applications came from 22 prisons, four correctional centres and one juvenile rehabilitation centre across the country, with 59 female inmates among the applicants.

Of the 671 requests, only one inmate will be granted a full pardon, while 389 are eligible for sentence reductions: 304 could receive a three-month reduction, 81 a six-month reduction and four a nine-month reduction.

According to the 2021 Royal Decree regarding sentence reduction and pardon, eligible inmates must demonstrate genuine reformation, adhere to prison rules and regulations and serve as role models for other inmates.

Elderly inmates, pregnant women, those with chronic illnesses or those with mental disabilities are also eligible to request pardons or sentence reductions.

Applications are submitted through prison directors to the commission for review, after which the prime minister makes a recommendation to the King.

As per the same Royal Decree, requests can be made for any offence after an inmate has served one-third of their sentence. Those serving life sentences may apply for reductions after 10 years, with the first reduction bringing the sentence down to 30 years.

However, in recent years, government leaders have instructed the commission not to grant reductions or pardons in the case of serious and violent crimes.

Am Sam Ath, operations director at rights group LICADHO, noted that in response to public criticism over leniency for serious crimes, there has been a decrease in pardons and reductions.

“Since the government’s response a few years ago, the number of inmates receiving clemency in the final decision review by the commission has fallen,” he said.

Sam Ath added that in special cases, the head of government retains the right to request sentence reductions or pardons as a political solution or in cases involving foreign nationals to promote cooperation.

He also mentioned that family members of opposition party activists have expressed concern that their imprisoned relatives remain absent from any list of approved sentence reductions or pardons.
