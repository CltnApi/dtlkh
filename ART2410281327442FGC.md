Cambodia anticipates a surge in international tourists following the launch of direct flights between Hanoi and Phnom Penh by Vietnam Airlines. The new service complements the daily flights currently operated by local carrier Angkor Air on the same route.

The inaugural Hanoi-Phnom Penh direct flight took place on October 27, offering a travel time of 1 hour and 55 minutes, with flights available four times a week (Monday, Wednesday, Friday and Sunday). Previously, the route included a stopover in Vientiane, Laos.

Chhay Sivlin, president of the Cambodia Tourism Association, highlighted that the new direct service is expected to boost tourism and trade between the two nations.

She said Hanoi’s status as an attractive destination with an international airport connecting multiple global flights is likely to enhance Cambodia’s appeal to international tourists, including the growing number of Vietnamese visitors to Phnom Penh.

Sivlin also noted that Vietnam Airlines will play a key role in promoting Cambodia's tourism and investment opportunities on a global scale.

She said alongside the new route, the airline also operates direct flights between Hanoi and Siem Reap province.

Dang Ngoc Hoa, chairman of Vietnam Airlines, expressed confidence that the new flights will enhance connectivity, serving not only as a bridge for passengers and goods but also as a "cultural ambassador" strengthening the friendship between the two countries.

“Vietnam Airlines remains committed to safe and efficient operations while expanding our flight network, fostering cooperation and improving service quality to meet the needs of passengers in both nations,” Hoa said.

Top Sopheak, secretary of state and spokesperson for the Ministry of Tourism, underscored that the country’s political stability and security are key factors in attracting international visitors.

“The increase in international flights to Cambodia will also help attract more international tourists and investors,” he said.

According to the ministry, the country welcomed 4.29 million international tourists from January to August, marking a 22.5% rise compared to the same period in 2023. Among these, 868,445 were Vietnamese nationals, reflecting a 35.3% year-on-year increase.

Vietnamese tourists ranked second after Thailand, which accounted for approximately 1.34 million visitors.

In 2019, Cambodia saw its highest influx of international tourists, reaching 6.61 million, a 6.6% increase from the previous year. Tourism revenue from international visitors that year totalled $4.92 billion, contributing 12.1% to the country’s GDP.
