# Six arrested as anti-corruption net widens

Ly Samet, Duong Dara, Kan Sokkay, Lay Viseth, Muong Khim and Uth Thy (from top right) have all been arrested as part of anti-graft investigations into the alleged sale of important government posts. Supplied

As of November 12, six people had been detained by law enforcement and the Anti-Corruption Unit (ACU), in connection with fraud and corruption cases involving disgraced Okhna Ly Samet.

The latest arrest made by the ACU was of Kan Sokkhay, former governor of Lvea Em district in Kandal province. Sokkhay was removed from his position by Prime Minister Hun Manet after it was revealed that he gifted $300,000 to Ly Samet in a fraudulent scheme to obtain the position of governor of Arey Ksattown in the same province.

The other detained individuals include Ly Samet, Duong Dara, formerly an assistant to then-Prime Minister Hun Sen, who is now president of the Senate, Muong Khim, a former three-star police officer, Oknha Uth Thy, a gemstone and construction magnate and Lay Viseth, deputy-governor of Pursat Province.

Early reports speculate that Viseth spent $570,000 in dealings with Samet to secure influential government roles.

Previously, Hun Sen exposed Samet’s misuse of his name to deceive others. He encouraged any victims involved to file complaints with Ky Tech, head of Hun Sen’s volunteer legal team.

Pen Bona, a government spokesperson, directed inquiries about the case to the relevant authorities, while Ky Tech did not respond to requests for additional comments on November 12. 

Similarly, ACU spokesperson Soy Chanvichet could not be reached for comment.

Pech Pisey, executive director of Transparency International Cambodia, believed that the legal action against Samet and Dara is a sign that the government is beginning to take measures against any officials close to the top leadership who misuse their power or engage in corruption. He suggested that the arrests will serve as a warning to others against using bribery to secure positions.

“Civil society organisations want to see a clean administration. To reduce conflicts of interest, we must ensure that appointments are based on principles of integrity and public service competence. Capable young officials who are dedicated to serving the nation should be encouraged, rather than allowing corrupt officials, some of whom are illiterate, to use bribery to obtain positions,” he said.
