Cambodian art history saw a momentous addition on November 4 at the Preah Srey Içanavarman Museum of Economy and Money (SOSORO).

The museum has proudly acquired a second painting by celebrated Khmer painter Nhek Dim, thanks to a generous donation by Dr. Milton Osborne, a distinguished Australian academic and former diplomat.

The artwork, a striking depiction of a rural Cambodian landscape, was officially presented to the museum on October 28 at the Siem Reap provincial branch of the National Bank of Cambodia (NBC). 

“This painting by Nhek Dim is a significant addition to the museum’s collection, and we are committed to its preservation and exhibition for future generations,” said SOSORO co-director Blaise Kilian, expressing deep gratitude for Dr. Osborne’s contribution. 

He also emphasised the importance of such donations in enriching the country’s cultural narrative and ensuring that the works of its iconic artists are not forgotten.

Dim, one of Cambodia’s most influential painters, is renowned for his ability to encapsulate the beauty of rural life in his works. 

His depictions of palm trees, rice fields and traditional stilt houses resonate with the essence of the country’s cultural and natural heritage. 

Tragically, much of his work was lost during the Khmer Rouge era, making surviving pieces all the more valuable.

Dr. Osborne, whose ties to Cambodia date back to 1959 when he served as an Australian diplomat in Phnom Penh, spoke with heartfelt admiration for the artist.

“This donation reflects my long-standing respect and admiration for the Cambodian people and their cultural resilience, exemplified by Nhek Dim’s work,” he shared during the handover ceremony.

The SOSORO Museum, widely regarded as a hub for preserving Cambodia’s history, has actively sought to bridge the country’s artistic and historical past with its economic evolution. 

The inclusion of Dim’s works aligns perfectly with this mission, offering visitors a glimpse into the flourishing artistic scene of post-independence Cambodia.

Dim’s career spanned a pivotal era in Cambodian history, with his works symbolising a period of optimism and cultural renaissance. 

His realist style and choice of subject matter captured the idyllic and timeless beauty of Cambodia’s countryside, alongside portraits of prominent cultural figures.

This marks the second Dim masterpiece to enter SOSORO’s collection in less than a year, following the earlier contribution of an artwork, also steeped in historical significance, from the Merrillees family.

The piece, dating back to the 1960s, was lauded as a testament to the enduring relevance of Dim’s work.

“The work of Nhek Dim is a reflection of the vibrant cultural and artistic scene that flourished in the post-independence years, before being sadly annihilated by the war and during the Khmer Rouge regime,” said Kilian.

“This donation is all the more meaningful as the museum has just inaugurated the revamped part of its permanent exhibition dedicated to independence, the Khmer Republic and the Khmer Rouge regime, with enhanced descriptions of the socioeconomic changes that occurred then,” he added. 

The addition of a second piece further cements the artist’s legacy within the country’s national heritage. 

It also underscores the international recognition of Cambodian art, as these donations have come from individuals deeply connected to the country’s past.

Dr. Osborne’s relationship with Cambodia extends beyond his early diplomatic career. A prolific author and expert on Southeast Asian history, he has dedicated much of his life to fostering understanding and appreciation of the region’s rich culture and tradition.
