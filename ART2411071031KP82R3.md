Around 100 illegal gold mining sites in Mondulkiri province’s Me Sam area, near Pu Tong village of Keo Seima district’s Chong Plas commune, have been raided by authorities since November 3. The operation aimed to eliminate unauthorised mining, which often involves the use of dangerous chemicals or explosives.

The operation involved a combined force of more than over 50 personnel. Drawn from the provincial administration, the Anti-Corruption Unit, the armed forces and the Ministry of Mines and Energy, among others, the provincial team was led by Chhit Sophal, deputy director of the provincial administration.

The officials also deployed heavy machinery to dismantle and destroy unauthorised mining pits and facilities.

“The operation has been ongoing since November 3 and is 98 per cent complete. It will be finished in another two hours. There are around 100 sites,” Sophal told The Post on the afternoon of Thursday, November 7.

He explained that the initial stage, no individuals had been arrested. The operation focused on clearing the sites to restore order and improve the environment.

“Our principle is not to make arrests at this stage. We only aim to clear out these unauthorised activities because the use of chemicals poses environmental risks. We want to clean up these sites and restore the environment. Penalties have not been decided upon yet,” he said.

He noted that the individuals involved were a mix of local residents and migrants, and added that they had fled the sites before the forces arrived, likely in fear of the authorities. Sophal said the operation did not disturb their homes but was solely focused on clearing the illegal mining sites.

A November 1 meeting was held ahead of the crackdown. Afterwards, the provincial administration issued a November 4 notification to residents that the authorities would enforce the law without exception for individuals involved in any form of illegal gold mining. 

This included digging, drilling, removing concrete coverings from mining pits, excavation, crushing, panning and collecting mining waste of all kinds.

The administration urged those involved to cease all activities immediately and to dismantle and remove any equipment related to illegal mining.

“In case of non-compliance, the authorities will dismantle and clear any equipment or sites related to unauthorised gold mining activities which involve the use of chemicals and explosives. They pose significant health hazards to humans, animals and the environment in these areas,” added the announcement.

The administration emphasised that no exceptions or leniency would be granted to those who had disturbed pits covered with concrete or other restricted areas, as these acts violated regulations, laws and previous instructions from the provincial authorities aimed at rehabilitating the area for better environmental conditions.
