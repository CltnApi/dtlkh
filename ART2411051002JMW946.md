Ly Thuch, first vice-president of the Cambodian Mine Action Authority (CMAA), has requested that the US continue to provide support for clearing landmines and explosive remnants of war (ERW), while noting that demining work remains Cambodia’s highest humanitarian priority.

The request was made during a November 5 meeting with Bridgette L. Walker, Chargé d’Affaires of the US embassy in Cambodia.

Following the meeting, a CMAA statement explained that Thuch had discussed Cambodia’s ongoing efforts, in collaboration with friendly nations and development partners, to address the issue of landmines, unexploded remnants from past wars and ongoing victim assistance.

He acknowledged that the US has been the Kingdom’s largest donor in humanitarian demining efforts and expressed his gratitude for over 30 years of US support, noting that the aid has made a significant contribution to saving lives and making land safe for Cambodians.

Thuch specifically requested continued US assistance, through the provision of specialised equipment for clearing mines and cluster munitions, protective gear and technical training. He also urged increased US support for cluster bomb clearance, Cambodia’s second-highest demining priority after mine clearance.

According to a US embassy spokesperson, “Walker wished Thuch success hosting the 5th Review Conference of the Ottawa Convention”, which is set to be held in Siem Reap province later this month.

“She also reiterated US support for helping remove landmines and unexploded ordnance (UXO) from Cambodia, as reaffirmed recently by USAID administrator Samantha Power, who announced an additional $12 million for landmine removal during her visit to the Kingdom last month,” added the spokesperson.

Heng Ratana, director-general of the Cambodian Mine Action Center (CMAC), stated that the US has been providing humanitarian demining aid to CMAC since 1993, a commitment set to continue through 2025.

He explained that at present, CMAC is actively clearing areas impacted by cluster bombs and other ERWs in several eastern provinces, including Prey Veng, Svay Rieng, Kampong Cham, Tbong Khmum and Kratie, covering a total of 121 square kilometres. The project, which is running from 2022 to 2025, is supported by $6.3 million in US aid.
