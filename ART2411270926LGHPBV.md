Prime Minister Hun Manet has affirmed that the government will no longer adjust boundaries or allocate land within the Tonle Sap Lake area. The decision aims to preserve the region for the shared benefit of citizens, both now and in the future, following the recent allocation of approximately 80,000 hectares.

Speaking at the closing ceremony of the "2024 Annual Review and Strategic Plan Conference of the Ministry of Land Management, Urban Planning and Construction" on November 26, the prime minister stated that after completing boundary demarcations for the lake, the government would not approve further land adjustments.

He noted that significant boundary changes had been made in recent years, rezoning the area to grant usage rights in specific areas.

“We have made almost all the necessary adjustments. Why would we need to revisit Zone 3 and Zone 2 again? We must protect the land for the benefit of 17 million citizens,” the prime minister said.

“We reallocated approximately 80,000 hectares from Zone 3 to Zones 1 and 2, granting usage rights to citizens. If we continue to allocate more – hundreds of thousands of hectares – the process will never end,” he added.

Manet stressed the government’s responsibility to protect the interests of citizens who have lived in the area for generations, while also safeguarding the ecosystem and biodiversity of the lake, which supports millions of people.

“Zone 3 is a strictly protected area. Allowing even 100 or 1,000 citizens to farm there could damage the Tonle Sap ecosystem. What will Cambodia’s future look like if we allow this? We must take responsibility.

“If we open every area to exploitation, it will harm the lake’s natural resources. Fertiliser and other agricultural activities like clearing will destroy the submerged forests, disrupt fish breeding grounds and deplete resources,” he explained.

“One hand of the government must balance the needs of a few hundred households and another hand is for the interests of 17 million citizens, ensuring benefits for all,” he said.

Manet noted that the protection of Tonle Sap Lake is not only for the 17 million current citizens but also for future generations, as the country’s population could rise to 20 or even 30 million in the coming decades.

The resolution of land use issues at the Tonle Sap is no different from other areas, requiring clearly defined boundaries and guidelines.

"Zone 3 is not for Deputy Prime Minister Say Samal, myself, any government official or the Tonle Sap Authority to claim ownership. I have no intention of building a home there. It is for the Cambodian people, the ecosystem, biodiversity and the future of our fish stocks."

He noted that in Zone 2, clear boundaries and regulations are in place. While no ownership or sales are permitted, residents can utilise the land or lease it from the government. The land in Zone 2 has been transferred to the six provinces surrounding the lake for management, use or granting rights solely for people to sustain their livelihoods.

The government is also exploring strategies to reduce reliance on the Tonle Sap for livelihoods, encouraging alternative income opportunities, such as industrial development, which uses less land but generates higher income.

“This is our strategy: creating jobs and alternative income sources for citizens while protecting the environment. As in the Amazon, if people are not allowed to cut down the forest, they have to find another source of income. If we want them to not depend on agriculture, we create a nearby industrial zone for them,” Manet explained.

After completing the boundary demarcations, the government will issue land-use policies, including restrictions on fertiliser usage, to prevent damage to biodiversity and soil quality.

“When water levels rise, they could destroy biodiversity and fish habitats. We will implement these policies rigorously, without hesitation to enforce the law,” he added, urging ministries and authorities to educate citizens about proper land use.

The Tonle Sap Authority recently completed installing 1,224 boundary markers for Zone 3 in the six provinces surrounding the lake: Kampong Chhnang, Pursat, Battambang, Banteay Meanchey, Siem Reap and Kampong Thom.

Samal stated that the ministry, in collaboration with the Tonle Sap Authority and local administrations, is committed to managing the area as per prior government resolutions. Additionally, he said policies are being developed to equitably manage Zone 2 resources while ensuring strict conservation of Zone 3, which is vital for securing food supplies, economic value – estimated at $2 billion annually – and the ecological integrity of the lake.

“The ministry has rejected all proposals to convert land from Zone 3 to Zone 2 and is committed to enforcing the law against encroachments,” Samal said.

To date, 85 per cent (217,339 out of 254,536 plots) of land in Zone 2 has been measured for use, and regular monitoring of Zones 2 and 3 will continue.

The Tonle Sap area is divided into three zones: Zone 1 for residential and productive areas where citizens hold legal ownership of land titles, Zone 2 for utilised areas for seasonal agriculture, water-based activities and as buffer zones, and Zone 3 for flooded forests and strictly protected zones to preserve biodiversity and ecosystems.
