More than 100 high-quality Cambodian products were exhibited by the Ministry of Commerce at an international trade expo in China, held from November 5-10.

The 7th China International Import Expo, themed “New Era, Shared Future”, took place at China’s National Exhibition and Convention Center in Shanghai with participation from 160 countries.

The ministry highlighted that the Cambodian exhibit included top-quality products such as rice, cashews, travel accessories, bags, geographically certified products, honey, coffee, dried mango, pepper, tea, pepper sauce, fermented fish powder, palm sugar, syrup and candy, instant noodles and recycled plastic crafts.

According to the ministry, the showcased items boast premium packaging and recognised hygiene standards both nationally and internationally. The booth featured LED screens promoting the country’s economic, trade, investment, cultural, art and tourism potential. 

It noted that the event provides Cambodian companies with the opportunity to engage in discussions and explore business collaborations with other companies attending the event.

Uon Silot, president of the Cashew nut Association of Cambodia (CAC), told The Post on November 7 that exhibiting domestic products at a global event would bring significant benefits by promoting and enhancing the country’s export potential in international markets. 

He added that both the government and private sector are actively seeking new markets to boost exports, with China currently a crucial trade partner for Cambodia.

He noted, "Cambodian agricultural products are in high demand in China. Bringing a variety of products to this event is excellent, given Cambodia’s high-potential agricultural sector."

Lim Heng, vice-president of the Cambodia Chamber of Commerce (CCC), emphasised that every promotional activity and product or service exhibition brings positive results for the country’s export market. 

He said participating in major international events such as the expo significantly supports the country’s national economy. He stated that increasing the number of products on display helps it gain more market access and business opportunities.

He added, “Large expos often attract a diverse range of visitors from different nationalities, offering exhibitors, investors and customers a chance to connect and discuss potential partnerships.”

According to statistics released by the General Department of Customs and Excise (GDCE) on October 10, total trade between Cambodia and its trading partners from January to September amounted to $40.94 billion, a 16.4% increase compared to the same period in 2023, which totalled $35.16 billion. 

Cambodia’s exports reached $19.83 billion during the period, up 17% from $16.94 billion, while imports were valued at $21.1 billion, a 15.9% increase from $18.21 billion. This left Cambodia with a trade deficit of approximately $1.27 billion, similar to the same period last year.
