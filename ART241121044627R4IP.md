The first-ever Southeast Asia School Meals Coalition Summit concluded on November 20 with a unified call to enhance child nutrition, education and local food systems across the region. 

Co-hosted by Cambodia, the Philippines and South Korea under the Global School Meals Coalition, the summit brought together 130 delegates from seven Southeast Asian countries and 39 partner organisations to discuss strategies for school meal programmes, according to a November 20 joint press release. 

The release said that the summit highlighted the crucial role of school meals in achieving multiple sustainable development goals (SDGs), from improving child health and education to supporting local agriculture and addressing climate change. 

It noted that while significant progress has been made in developing policies and scaling programmes, participants agreed that further efforts are needed to ensure quality, coverage and sustainability.

“School meals are more than just sustenance; they are a foundation for learning, growth and transformation,” said Hang Chuon Naron, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Education, Youth and Sport, was quoted as saying. 

He emphasised the role of nutrition in fostering cognitive development and academic success, stressing that prioritising children’s nutritional needs is an investment in their future potential.

Discussions during the three-day summit focused on strengthening cross-sectoral collaboration, integrating nutrition standards and adopting innovative approaches such as climate-smart agriculture and clean cooking. 

Delegates also explored sustainable financing options, including climate and blended financing mechanisms, to expand programme reach and ensure long-term success.

Dexter Galban, assistant secretary at the Philippine education department, shared his country’s significant achievements in school meals, having tripled investments in recent years and extended programme coverage to a full year. 

“School meals aren't just about food. It's about ensuring that every child, no matter where they are born, has a chance to learn, to thrive, and to dream big,” he said, underscoring the importance of partnerships spanning agriculture, health and education.

South Korean ambassador to Cambodia Park Jung-Wook shared insights from his country’s five decades of experience in delivering universal school meals. 

“The enhanced procurement system of school meals led to improvements in the local food industry as well,” he said, emphasising the broader economic benefits of well-designed school meal programmes.

The summit concluded with a commitment to collective action, with the Philippines set to host the next regional summit and Cambodia planning to engage the ASEAN Secretariat to expand regional collaboration on school meals, according to the press release.
