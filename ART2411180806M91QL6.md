This year’s annual three-day Water Festival concluded on Sunday, with over 7.8 million domestic and international tourists participating in celebrations across Cambodia. More than 6.2 million guests flocked to the capital, according to the Ministry of Tourism.

The festival, held from November 14 to 16, showcased the nation’s rich cultural heritage but also saw isolated incidents of theft, missing relatives and minor scuffles.

According to the General Commissariat of National Police, one significant altercation involved a Cambodian citizen and two Koreans.

The individuals were detained and sent to the police station in Daun Penh commune for further investigation.

“Authorities also reported 176 cases of missing individuals, including one Indian national, six elderly people, and 169 children,” the national police shared, via a November 17 social media post.

However, it confirmed that each of the missing persons was safely reunited with their families.

Security challenges extended to property theft, with one motorcycle reported stolen near the Neang Machha roundabout and three incidents of phone theft. Investigations are ongoing to recover the stolen items and apprehend the culprits.

Despite these minor incidents, the tourism ministry hailed the festival as a major success. A ministry report revealed an impressive 21.4 per cent increase in domestic tourism compared to the previous year.
