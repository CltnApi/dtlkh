In a modest home nestled in the lush landscapes of Takeo province’s Bati district, a group of American Peace Corps volunteers are forging deep connections with their Cambodian host families. 

Katheryn Potts, one of the newest volunteers, recalls her first day, arriving in Phnom Penh with wide eyes, excited and ready to work.

“Every day, we learned the Khmer language and teaching methods, but our true learning happened at home, where we spent time with our Cambodian families,” she says, speaking in Khmer. 

“My host mother would always call me to eat together, and we shared laughter and stories around the dinner table,” she adds. 

Katheryn's story is not unique. It encapsulates the experience of many volunteers who have been part of the Peace Corps programme in Cambodia since its inception in 2007. 

Today, October 18, the 16th cohort of volunteers were officially sworn in during a ceremony in Phnom Penh. 

The event marked the continuation of a partnership between Cambodia and the US, solidifying their relationship through people-to-people diplomacy and educational collaboration.

The ceremony was attended by several prominent Cambodian officials, including Takeo provincial deputy governor Ly Saveth.

During the event, Saveth emphasised the personal and cultural growth the volunteers underwent during training.

“You have learned to live with the Cambodian community, to eat Cambodian food and to communicate with local people,” he said. “It is not easy being away from your home and family, but you have shown strength and determination, adapting well over the past two months of training,” he said.

Since the Peace Corps began its work in Cambodia, over 800 volunteers have served in various roles across the country. 

The programme focuses primarily on education, with volunteers teaching English and supporting local schools in rural areas. 

English proficiency, viewed as a critical skill for Cambodia’s development, has been at the heart of the partnership between the two nations.

**Education as a bridge**

In a country where foreign language skills are becoming increasingly vital for economic and social development, Peace Corps volunteers play a crucial role in supporting Cambodia’s education reform.

Since 2007, they have taught English at primary, secondary and teacher training institutions. 

Their efforts complement the country’s broader education policy, which emphasises the importance of English and technology skills for students.

Put Samith, undersecretary of state at the Ministry of Education, Youth and Sport, spoke at the ceremony about the transformative impact the volunteers have had. 

“The education ministry recognises the importance of learning foreign languages, especially English, as well as digital skills. These are essential for students who aspire to work or study abroad and contribute to Cambodia's growth in the 21st century,” he said.

He acknowledged that the Peace Corps has been instrumental in improving both teacher and student capacities, aligning with the country’s ongoing education reform, which has seen significant developments over the past decade. 

Volunteers bring new teaching methods, encourage interactive learning and foster a supportive environment in classrooms, all while working closely with their Cambodian counterparts.

Their impact extends beyond academic instruction. As they integrate into their communities, they foster mutual understanding between Cambodians and Americans. 

In many ways, the relationships built between volunteers and their host families have become the cornerstone of the programme's success.

**Cultural exchange: A two-way street**

For most volunteers, their time in Cambodia is about more than teaching English – it’s about bridging cultures. 

“The Peace Corps mission has three goals,” explained Katheryn. “To provide human resources to countries in need, to promote American culture abroad, and to bring the culture of the countries where we serve back to the US." 

She spoke warmly about her experience living with a Cambodian family, describing how her sister would practice English with her, often reminiscing about previous volunteers with affection. 

Katherine Mazzer, another volunteer stationed in Bati, added that the district is not just a place of work for them; it’s their home. 

“We’ve fallen in love with the spirit of the people here. We’ve shared meals, laughter and life lessons,” she said. 

Speaking in Khmer, she praised the warmth and generosity of her host family, who have become her Cambodian family over time.

This cultural exchange works both ways. Volunteers not only share their experiences and traditions with Cambodians, but they also learn about local customs, traditions and values, which they bring back with them to the US. 

Bridgette L. Walker, Chargé d’Affaires at the US embassy in Phnom Penh, noted during the ceremony, “The volunteers are eager to join a distinguished group of Peace Corps members, but they often find that the hardest part of leaving Cambodia is saying goodbye to their host families, colleagues, students and Cambodian friends.”

“When these volunteers return to the US, they will have much to share about Cambodia, in effect becoming ambassadors for both cultures,” she added.

**Building people-to-people connectivity**

Cambodia and the Peace Corps have shared a formal relationship since 1994, when the corps first signed an agreement to send service members to Cambodia. This paved the way for the country to welcome its first group of volunteers in 2007.

Since then, the programme has grown steadily, reflecting the mutual benefits of this unique partnership. 

Nom Piseth, undersecretary of state at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation, highlighted the importance of people-to-people connectivity in fostering deeper diplomatic ties.

“The dispatch of 32 new volunteers today will significantly contribute to promoting people-to-people connectivity between Cambodia and the US,” said Piseth. “Your work here will not only strengthen the English language skills of Cambodian students but also build friendships that will last a lifetime.”

This sentiment was echoed by Peace Corps country director Kim Mansaray who underscored the significance of the volunteers’ work in Cambodia’s provinces. 

“The work you are about to begin goes beyond personal success. It’s about service, collaboration and making a difference in the lives of others,” Mansaray said, addressing the newly sworn-in volunteers.

**A legacy of service and learning**

Over the past 63 years, more than 240,000 Americans have served in the Peace Corps in 142 countries, each contributing to a legacy of international friendship and service. 

In Cambodia, that legacy continues to grow. As the volunteers begin their two-year assignments, they are poised to make a lasting impact on the students they teach, the communities they serve and the relationships they build.

Walker said that in Cambodia, the Peace Corps is proud to partner with government counterparts and community stakeholders to help further English education across the country. 

“As you've heard, volunteers live with host families during their two years of service and work side by side with Cambodian people in sharing innovative teaching practices, designing and delivering classroom lessons, building communicative English skills and introducing effective classroom management techniques,” she said. 

She noted that volunteers also develop and introduce new technologies and learning resources for the classroom.

“The road ahead will not be easy, but it will be fulfilling. You represent the best that our country has to offer, and your dedication to service is an inspiration to all,” said Walker. 

In his closing remarks, Michael Keel, Peace Corps Cambodia's director of programming and training, reminded the volunteers of the significance of their journey.

He mentioned that they had challenged the group to meet high standards in order to prepare them for life and work in Cambodia. 

Keel said that it was now an honour to say that everyone was ready, and also acknowledged the Peace Corps staff for their dedication and hard work over the past 10 weeks.

“Every year, these staff leave their homes and their families to live at the training site for two months. They work six days a week to train each new group of volunteers,” he added. 

As they disperse to different provinces, these volunteers carry with them not just lesson plans and teaching strategies, but a spirit of friendship and mutual respect that continues to strengthen the bond between Cambodia and the US.
