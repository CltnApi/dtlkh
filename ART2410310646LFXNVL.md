The Ministry of Health launched a nationwide measles-rubella (MR) vaccination campaign on October 31, aiming to vaccinate over 1.5 million children between the ages of nine months and five years across 25 provinces.

Supported by Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, along with the World Health Organization (WHO), UNICEF and the Clinton Health Access Initiative (CHAI), the campaign is part of a broader effort to strengthen Cambodia's health security and prevent potential outbreaks, according to an October 31 joint press release.

The release stated that the vaccination push comes in response to a global surge in measles and rubella cases, with recent years seeing cases more than double due to disruptions in routine immunisations during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Cambodia, though removed from WHO’s High TB Burden list in 2021, still faces heightened risks of infectious disease outbreaks, especially in vulnerable populations.

"Health personnel have done a good job during previous immunisation campaigns, and I am sure that during this campaign too, health staff will do everything they can to reach all children, especially those living in high-risk and hard-to-reach areas," health minister Chheang Ra was quoted as saying.

According to the release, the campaign, divided into two phases, will cover 13 capital-provinces in the first phase, including Phnom Penh, Siem Reap and Battambang, from November 25 to December 6. The second phase will then target the remaining 12 provinces. All vaccinations are available free of charge at health centres under the ministry.

WHO representative to Cambodia Dr. Marianna Trias emphasised the importance of the effort, noting, "This nationwide campaign is a vital step towards health equity, ensuring that no one is left behind in our mission to promote, protect and provide health for all."

With support from organisations such as Gavi, UNICEF and CHAI, the campaign aims not only to administer vaccines but also to boost awareness and engage with communities, ensuring a high coverage rate and contributing to Cambodia’s goal of becoming MR-free, according to the release.
