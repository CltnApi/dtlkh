Cambodia is currently addressing the complexities of human trafficking carried out by foreign nationals employing diverse and deceptive methods, according to a senior official at the National Committee for Counter Trafficking (NCCT).

Chou Bun Eng, secretary of state at the Ministry of Interior and permanent vice-chair of the NCCT, stated on November 19 that most human trafficking cases involve foreign perpetrators who employ sophisticated methods of exploitation and manipulation.

She added that some foreigners traffic victims within Cambodia, while others reside in the country and lure victims from abroad through fraud and manipulation.

"Some human trafficking cases involve foreign offenders deceiving citizens of other nationalities or Cambodian citizens. In some instances, offenders target victims of their same nationality. These cases involve various forms of trafficking, surrogacy, threats and tactics carried out online, by phone or in person," she was quoted as saying in a ministry media statement.

In 2023, Cambodia reported 164 cases of human trafficking and sexual exploitation, leading to the arrest of 194 individuals. Among these, 24 cases were classified as human trafficking and 140 involved sexual exploitation. That same year, 342 Cambodian victims were repatriated, including 322 from China.

During the first six months of 2024, authorities handled 104 cases of human trafficking and exploitation, arrested 134 suspects and rescued 290 victims, according to the committee's half-year report.

The NCCT annual report also revealed that in 2023, the country detained and deported 2,159 foreign offenders involved in 512 various crimes, including 1,011 Chinese nationals.

Bun Eng could not be reached for comment on November 19.

In 2023, the US Department of State’s Trafficking in Persons Report ranked Cambodia in Tier 3, the lowest ranking. This placed the country on par with Myanmar and below neighbouring countries such as Laos, Thailand and Vietnam.

Bun Eng urged relevant authorities to intensify efforts to combat human trafficking, a pressing global issue increasingly linked to online platforms.

"Authorities must feel the urgency to act when Cambodia is placed in the lowest tier of global rankings for combating human trafficking. We must act decisively to address this issue and avoid complacency,” she said.
