# Dozen Japanese suspects deported from Cambodia as ‘special fraud’ cases surge

Local authorities last week transferred twelve Japanese men believed to be members of a crime ring back to Japan, where they were accused of fraud.

The twelve men, aged between 18 and 45, are believed to be “callers,” who pose as police offers during calls to victims in Japan over the telephone in attempting to defraud them.

On August 2 and 7, local police took them into custody from a room in a building in the city of Bavet, located in southeastern Cambodia. Inside the building, notes and a dozen smartphones believed to have been used in the crimes were found.
