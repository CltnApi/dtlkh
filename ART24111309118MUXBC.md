The Cambodian government is honoured to host the Southeast Asia School Meals Coalition Summit, set to take place in Siem Reap from November 18 to 20. The event aims to bolster human resource development and enhance food systems reform.

The summit, organised under the umbrella of the Global School Meals Coalition, is expected to make a major contribution to advancing human capital development and transforming food systems in the region, according to a November 12 press release.

“It aims to ensure that every child in Southeast Asia and beyond receives a healthy and nutritious school meal every day by 2030,” it added.

The Cambodian government, through the Ministry of Education, Youth and Sport, is currently implementing a school meal programme which uses locally produced agricultural products and covers nearly two-thirds of the Kingdom’s primary schools. Cambodia is committed to reach 1,114 primary schools and provide meals for 300,000 children by 2028.

The National Social Protection Council (NSPC) noted that the target schools are located in Siem Reap, Kampong Thom, Preah Vihear, Battambang, Stung Treng, Banteay Meanchey, Kampong Cham, Kampong Chhnang, Pursat and Oddar Meanchey, the 10 provinces with the highest levels of poverty.

The initiative, which is run in collaboration with the UN World Food Programme, contributes to human resource development by providing nutritious breakfasts to schoolchildren.

Additionally, the education ministry has drafted the “National Policy on School Feeding 2024–2035”, a strategic document aimed at realising the government’s vision to improve children's nutrition, health, and education, while supporting local economic development.

The release also highlighted Cambodia’s commitment to increasing the number of scholarships which are available to vulnerable students, from 250,000 students in the 2023-24 school year to around 650,000 by early 2025. This includes ensuring optimal nutrition and a conducive food environment, optimising procurement and distribution processes, building institutional capabilities and securing sustainable financial support.

Education minister Hang Chuon Naron believed the upcoming summit will provide a crucial platform for governments and partners to come together, exchange best practices and reaffirm their commitment to providing nutritious meals for young learners, thus leveraging the school meal programme as a social protection instrument. 

“This summit underscores Cambodia's dedication to nurturing human capital, fostering economic growth and ensuring the well-being of children,” he said. 

The summit will include high-level representatives from Southeast Asia, along with delegates from China, Japan and South Korea. 

The agenda will include discussions on improving the quality and efficiency of school meals and nutrition programmes, strengthening policy frameworks, enhancing sustainable financing mechanisms and fostering multi-sectoral coordination.
