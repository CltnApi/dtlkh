PeopleStories, a development agency dedicated to improving education in rural Cambodia, has been awarded the prestigious “Best e-Learning Project” at the 2024 LearnX Awards. 

The accolade recognises the charity’s innovative Mobile Digital School (MDS), a pioneering initiative designed to bring digital learning to remote communities across the country. 

The announcement was made on the evening of November 26 during a ceremony held by LearnX, an Australian international awards programme that celebrates excellence in learning, development and talent management.

PeopleStories founder and executive director Victoria Miloschewsky accepted the award on behalf of her team. In her speech, she expressed her gratitude and highlighted the transformative power of technology in education. 

“I am truly honoured to receive this esteemed award. It underscores the dedication and hard work our team has put into bringing digital education to the underserved children of rural Cambodia,” said Miloschewsky.

“Our MDS is reshaping the learning experience, taking it from ‘chalk and talk’ to ‘flick and click’, and is opening doors for thousands of children who had limited access to quality education.”

The MDS is not just a classroom on the move – it’s a fully equipped mobile learning hub that brings high-quality, digital-based education to remote villages. 

PeopleStories converted an old tuk-tuk into a classroom, outfitting it with laptops, educational software and a remote server to ensure access to learning without the need for a constant internet connection. 

The "school-on-wheels" travels from village to village, providing children with a chance to engage in digital learning activities anytime, anywhere.

“The MDS concept has proven to be a game-changer. Many children in rural areas have never had the opportunity to use a computer before, let alone use one for their education,” said Miloschewsky. “Our MDS not only brings digital literacy but also encourages critical thinking, creativity and problem-solving skills, all of which are essential in today’s rapidly changing world.”

**Transforming education in rural Cambodia**

In Cambodia’s capital, Phnom Penh, urban development and access to education have been growing rapidly. 

However, rural communities continue to face significant educational challenges, including inadequate infrastructure, limited resources and low digital literacy. 

PeopleStories aims to bridge this gap by providing children with the tools they need to succeed in an increasingly digital world.

Since its launch in 2022, the MDS has delivered over 30,000 learning hours, benefiting more than 1,200 children. 

The initiative has helped youth develop vital skills that will serve them throughout their lives.

“When we first introduced the MDS to rural communities, there was a mix of excitement and nervousness,” Miloschewsky recalled. 

“Children were eager to learn but were also apprehensive. Many had never touched a laptop before. Now, after a few sessions, they’re not just comfortable using the technology – they’re thriving.”

One of the key features of the MDS is its blended learning approach, which combines digital lessons with in-person activities. 

This model allows for group projects, digital games and problem-solving exercises, all of which complement Cambodia's national curriculum. 

This combination of digital learning and interactive in-person activities ensures that children are not only gaining technical skills but are also improving their critical thinking and reasoning abilities.

**Critical thinking course**

A standout component of the MDS is the “critical thinking” course, which has been instrumental in improving the reasoning abilities of students. 

PeopleStories chief e-Learning designer and volunteer Andreas Fischer noted that the course has been a major success, with 97 per cent of children showing significant improvements in their reasoning skills. 

“We’ve seen remarkable progress in how children approach problem-solving,” Fischer said. “Through this course, they’ve learned to question assumptions, evaluate information critically and make informed decisions.”

The success of the class has been one of the most tangible outcomes of the MDS. 

It addresses a critical gap in education, where traditional teaching methods often focus on rote memorisation rather than fostering independent thought. 

The course empowers children to think for themselves, a vital skill in a global economy that increasingly values innovation and creativity.

Kan Channmeta, secretary of state at the Ministry of Industry, Science, Technology and Innovation, praised the initiative, highlighting the role of digital education in the country’s development. 

“As our government promotes digitalisation, I am proud to see the impact PeopleStories is making in rural communities. This kind of innovation is exactly what our younger generations need to stay competitive and creative in a rapidly evolving world,” Channmeta said.

**Overcoming challenges in remote areas**

Despite the success of the MDS, the journey has faced challenges. One of the biggest obstacles PeopleStories faced was the lack of reliable internet access in rural areas. 

In response, the team developed a remote server system, allowing them to deliver high-quality, web-based digital learning without relying on an internet connection. 

This creative solution has been key to the success of the project, enabling the “school-on-wheels” to bring learning to areas that would otherwise be cut off from digital resources.

“We had to be resourceful. In rural Cambodia, internet connectivity is inconsistent at best, so we designed a system that allows us to store all the necessary content locally,” Miloschewsky explained. “This way, our students can still benefit from interactive, web-based learning experiences even in the most remote areas.”

**Looking ahead: Scaling MDS**

The recognition from LearnX has given PeopleStories a significant boost, helping the charity attract new partners and supporters. 

Miloschewsky emphasised that the award not only validates their work but also highlights the importance of expanding access to digital education in rural Cambodia. 

“This recognition allows us to showcase the impact we’ve had and to demonstrate that it is possible to provide high-quality education even in the most remote corners of the world,” she said.

With over 12 million people living in rural areas, the need for educational reform remains urgent. 

PeopleStories is committed to scaling the MDS and expanding its reach to more communities. 

The charity is in discussions with impact investors who share its vision for a digitally literate and empowered generation of Cambodians.

“We’ve only just begun. The MDS has already made a difference in the lives of so many children, and we’re excited to reach even more,” Miloschewsky told _The Post._  

“We believe that every child, no matter where they live, deserves a chance to unlock their potential.”
