The highly anticipated Bonn Phum on the Move festival is set to captivate visitors from November 22-24 in Cambodia’s picturesque northeast province of Mondulkiri. 

The annual event blends cultural celebrations, art performances and a focus on ecotourism to showcase the country’s rich traditions and the natural beauty of its lesser-explored regions.

This year, the festival highlights the province’s ecotourism, celebrating its expansive grasslands, majestic elephants and the vibrant traditions of the indigenous Punong people.

Elephants, long revered in the country’s history, play a central role in the festival’s narrative.

“The Bonn Phum on the Move festival aims to showcase the unique ecotourism offerings of Mondulkiri while preserving its cultural heritage,” said Rithy Lomropich, also known as YoKi, co-founder of the event. “Our mission is to bring attention to lesser-known provinces and promote their beauty to the world.”

In addition to dramatic performances, the celebrations feature traditional buffalo slaughter ceremonies conducted by the Punong, offering a rare glimpse into their spiritual practices and community celebrations.

The event promises a rich cultural experience over three days, each with its own distinct theme and activities. 

On November 22 the festival kicks off by celebrating World Children’s Day at Pulung Primary School, with events centred on enabling children and youth under the theme, “Empowering Children and Youth, Growing a Healthier Planet”.

Day two features the Iron Elephant Garden transformed into a lively concert venue, featuring performances by indigenous artists alongside celebrated talents from Phnom Penh. 

The festival will culminate on day three, November 24, with a showcase of traditional arts, indigenous dramas and captivating cultural performances, including a highlight act by renowned Khmer classical dancer Sokea Kimleang, or Kon Ant, who will enchant audiences with _The Goddess in the Forest Casts a Magical Spell to Create an Elephant_.

One of the highlights will be a reimagined performance of the drama _Kuchri Kuch Roeng_, derived from the ancient story of Ream Ker, an epic tale from Hindu mythology.

This theatrical masterpiece, along with Lakhon Khol performances by the Ministry of Culture and Fine Arts, aims to blend Cambodia's artistic legacy with the vibrancy of contemporary storytelling.

“This festival celebrates the identity, culture and art of the region, while bringing it closer to the public,” YoKi explained. 

“We’ve named it ‘Bonn Phum on the Move’ because the festival travels – as if it had legs – to regions and provinces that need recognition and promotion.”

Mondulkiri’s culinary treasures will also take centre stage. Visitors can indulge in fresh local produce, including the province’s famous passion fruit, aromatic coffee and ethnic dishes that reflect the diversity of its communities.

“Prepare for a gastronomic adventure,” an organiser enthused. “From indigenous delicacies to vibrant flavours unique to Mondulkiri, this is a feast you don’t want to miss.”

The celebrations were organised in collaboration with UNICEF Cambodia, which highlights children’s rights through its ongoing partnership with the Bonn Phum festival. 

This year’s World Children’s Day celebration emphasises the resilience and potential of the youth while advocating for their rights.

“Today, we celebrate the incredible potential, resilience and voices of children everywhere,” said a representative from UNICEF Cambodia. “Together, we can build a world where every child thrives.”

The event also partners with KampumEra, focusing on youth engagement and artistic promotion, ensuring a broad appeal to all age groups.

Visitors from Phnom Penh can easily access the festival through a discounted-fare bus provided by BookMeBus, enabling more people to partake in the festivities and experience the province’s charm.

The event, now in its second year, has already made significant strides in spotlighting the country’s diverse regions. 

Last year’s event in Kratie province highlighted the Mekong dolphin, a symbol of the Mekong River’s ecological importance. 

“This year, Mondulkiri takes the stage, presenting elephants and the Punong people as symbols of its rich biodiversity and cultural tapestry,” YoKi told _The Post_. 

Whether you’re drawn by the art, the food or the opportunity to experience Mondulkiri’s untamed beauty, the festival promises a memorable journey into Cambodia’s cultural heartland.

As Kon Ant performs her enchanting dance and the gongs of the Punong people echo through the hills, visitors will leave with a deeper appreciation of the province’s untold stories and its place as a gem of Cambodian ecotourism.
