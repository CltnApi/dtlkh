India's Neelakandan Neena kicks Nou Sreypov in the face in Sunday's final. The Indian fighter won the first two rounds but went on to lose the match. PEAK

In a classic display of Khmer grit, Cambodia’s kickboxing team made history on their home turf at the 2024 Asian Kickboxing Championships, securing a total of 41 medals. The Kingdom’s athletes claimed 9 gold, 4 silver, and 28 bronze medals, cementing their place among the region’s kickboxing elite.

Held at the National Olympic Stadium in Phnom Penh from October 6 to 13, the competition saw Cambodia secure 4th place on the medal table, of the 23 participating countries. Uzbekistan led the medal table with 20 golds, 5 silvers, and 3 bronzes, while Kazakhstan and Vietnam claimed the 2nd and 3rd positions respectively.

Among many standout performances, Chhong Visal was the first Cambodian fighter to clinch a gold medal, defeating Vietnam’s Nguyen Si Thang in the -51kg FC category on October 12.

The squad continued their dominance, with Kham Khlaneang adding another gold in the K1 -51kg category after a thrilling win over Kazakhstan's Zhumabayev Nursultan.

As the tournament reached its final stages, Cambodian fighters turned up the heat, claiming 7 additional gold medals on the closing day. Chha Chanden won gold in the K1 -48kg after defeating India’s Khati Solomi on points, while Touch Chanvotey secured gold, in the KL -55kg, overcoming Indonesia’s Pieters Diandra Ariesta. Phoin Chanthy also claimed gold, defeating Indonesia's Aziz Abdul in his final match.

In one of the competition’s most dramatic moments, Tuon Sreyphin delivered a heart-stopping victory by forcing her Kuwaiti opponent, Alkharif Seham, to concede in the 3rd round of their K1 -56kg match, securing another gold for the Kingdom. Similarly, Him Koemrieng triumphed over Vietnam's Nguyen Ngoc Hoang in the LK -54kg category, to add yet more gold to Team Cambodia’s trophy cabinet.

One of the most touching tales of the championships came from married couple Sok Rith and Nou Sreypov, who both secured gold medals in their respective categories. Rith defeated Thailand's Phrommakhot Netipong in the LK -51kg final, while Sreypov triumphed over India’s Neelakandan Neena in the LC -55kg category.

Sreypov’s victory was particularly emotional. After losing the first two rounds to Neena, Sreypov mounted a stunning comeback in the third round, landing two decisive punches to win the match 2-1. Overcome with emotion, Sreypov shed tears of joy after earning her first gold medal, a moment she dedicated to her father. 

“I’ve achieved my dream today!" she exclaimed after the match. "Even though I didn’t win gold in the SEA Games, this gold means more to me than any games medal."

Her husband, Sok Rith, was equally moved by his wife’s victory. “I was nervous when she lost the first two rounds,” he admitted. “But I never doubted her. She worked so hard for this, and it’s her first gold. I’m incredibly proud of her.”

The closing ceremony was addressed by Khim Bunsong, secretary of state at the Ministry of National Defence, who praised the event as a massive success. 

He commended the joint efforts of the Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports, the National Olympic Committee of Cambodia, the Cambodian Kickboxing Federation, and their development partners for their seamless cooperation in hosting such a prestigious event.

“This championship has been a great success and a monumental achievement for Cambodia,” said Bunsong. 

“It’s an incredible honour to host this competition, and it helps showcase Cambodia’s culture, values, and development on the international stage,” he added.

With a record-breaking 41 medals and a new level of recognition on the world stage, Cambodia has firmly established itself as a rising force in the region. The 2024 Asian Kickboxing Championships will surely be remembered as a milestone in the nation’s sporting history.
