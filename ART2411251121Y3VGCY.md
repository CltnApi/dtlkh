The Cambodian Kun Khmer team achieved mixed results at the historic first-ever International Cambodian Kun Khmer Championship, held in Heraklion, on the Greek island of Crete. 

Cambodian fighters Thun Rithy, Sorn Rakhim, Kim Vassna, and Thun Sihong all won their respective belts, but the highly regarded Lorn Panha chose not to accept his belt, giving it away to another fighter.

In the competition on Sunday night, young fighter Sihong took less than a round to secure victory, defeating Greece's Tahir Dervishi by knockout at the end of round one in the 57kg class. Sihong's powerful strikes led to a quick finish, with the referee counting Dervishi out after a series of blows.

Kim Vassna dominated his 72kg bout, knocking out Greece's Vasilis Paraskevopoulos at the end of the second round, while Rakhim also delivered a second-round knockout in the 63.5kg category, defeating Greece's Ention Mouchai. In the 75kg division, Rithy won his belt by points, overcoming Greece's Panagiotis Kousis in a hard-fought decision.

Panha, a gold medalist at the 2023 SEA Games, was originally going to receive the 66kg belt after his Greek opponent Mario Gousho was unable to compete due to health issues. 

However, Panha refused to accept it, stating that it held no value if he hadn’t fought for it.

“The belt is beautiful, and I want it, but if we didn’t compete, what’s the point? It has no value because I came here to fight and showcase Cambodian Kun Khmer, but I didn’t get to fight,” he said.

As a result of his decision, the event organisers decided that the 66kg belt would be contested by Cambodian fighter Kong Sambo and Greece's Petro Sacho. 

Sacho triumphed on points, winning the belt in an exciting contest. Sacho’s victory made Panha’s refusal to accept the belt even more memorable, as it was the only one claimed by a Greek fighter during the event.

In a match for an honorary title, the host nation’s Matin Latifi was defeated by Cambodian veteran Long Sovandoeun, who won by knee strikes in the second round after Latifi submitted. 

Greek fighter Fani Peloumpi was able to take a points win over Cambodia’s Toun Sreypenh.
