Prime Minister Hun Manet has reaffirmed his stance against the issuance of mining licenses in the Prey Lang Wildlife Sanctuary. 

As he addressed the closing ceremony of the Ministry of Mines and Energy's 2023-2024 annual results meeting in Phnom Penh on November 21, he emphasised the importance of preserving the sanctuary's ecological integrity.

“The Ministry of Mines and Energy must review licensed areas in Prey Lang that are inactive or lack potential and revoke those licenses. Furthermore, no new licenses will be issued in the Prey Lang region. If such proposals are brought to me, I will not sign them,” said the prime minister.

While acknowledging the need for domestic mineral extraction to reduce dependency on costly imports, Hun Manet called for a comprehensive study to delineate areas suitable for mining without impacting protected zones.

The Prey Lang Wildlife Sanctuary, which spans approximately 3,600 square kilometres across Kampong Thom, Preah Vihear, Kratie and Stung Treng provinces, is among Southeast Asia's last remaining lowland evergreen forests.

Despite its ecological importance, the sanctuary faces significant threats from illegal logging and mining activities.

In December 2023, the prime minister implemented measures to halt the issuance of new mining licenses and prevent the expansion of existing operations in the sanctuary.

He described the decision as part of broader efforts to safeguard one of Cambodia's most vital environmental resources.
