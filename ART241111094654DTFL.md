Prime Minister Hun Manet has instructed Kep provincial authorities to prioritise security and public order, with a focus on preventing covert online scams in the province.

He expressed his vision for Kep to become a "tourism gem" rather than a site for illegal activities.

Manet made the remarks at the official inauguration of the Techo Santepheap Angkol Beach Road – a 12-kilometre coastal road project valued at $10 million and funded by the Asian Development Bank (ADB) – in Kep on November 11.

He reiterated that the province would not allow casinos and urged officials to take strong measures against security threats posed by both local and foreign criminals, specifically highlighting online scams.

“There should be no hidden online scam operations. Foreign criminals who come and rent \[properties\] to conduct online scams should be stopped and closely monitored. In the past, we had some loopholes, but we have been addressing this issue to prevent such activities in Kep, Kampot and other provinces,” he said.

Regarding the rejection of requests to establish casinos, Manet stated, “Permits may be given for special economic zones (SEZs), ecotourism or other projects, but not for casinos in Kep.”

In July, the prime minister banned the establishment of new casinos in Kep and Kampot provinces, with the exception of Bokor Mountain.

For the province's long-term development, he urged Kep's leadership to focus on developing it as a tourism destination with an emphasis on natural resources, including forests, the sea and marine biodiversity.

He also highlighted the importance of zoning the province to protect natural resources and manage urban planning effectively to avoid high-rise developments similar to those seen in Sihanoukville town.

Additionally, Manet mentioned that the government is exploring the development of recreational routes, such as bike paths, across the country’s four coastal provinces – Koh Kong, Preah Sihanouk, Kep and Kampot.
