The Ministry of Environment and its partner Wildlife Alliance (WA) on November 27 rejected allegations of deforestation at REDD+ projects made in a recent _France 24_ video titled “Real Carbon, False Credits? Investigating Mass Deforestation in Cambodia”.

The ministry criticised the video for spreading misrepresentations and causing public confusion about the country’s carbon credit REDD+ projects, asserting that it relied on outdated images and footage from years ago.

“The ministry rejects claims based on exaggerated information. The ministry has been implementing the REDD+ project for carbon credits, with clear national and international mechanisms for assessment and audit, to ensure effective protection and management of forest-rich protected areas and other biodiversity,” stated a joint press release.

Cambodia's REDD+ initiatives, including the Southern Cardamom and Keo Seima REDD+ projects, adhere strictly to internationally recognised standards, such as the Verified Carbon Standard (VCS), Climate, Community & Biodiversity (CCB) Standards and Sustainable Development Verified Impact Standard (SD VISta), the release added.

WA reaffirmed its unwavering commitment to forest conservation, environmental sustainability and the protection of indigenous rights.

“We take issue with the recent _France 24_ video, which presents a distorted and misleading narrative about the impact of REDD+ projects on deforestation and indigenous communities’ access to land,” the organisation said, emphasising that these initiatives undergo rigorous, repeated audits by third-party international experts to ensure measurable, verifiable and sustainable benefits for the environment and local communities alike.

The organisations highlighted that through these projects, Cambodia has mobilised resources to preserve its forests and improve the livelihoods of forest-dependent communities. Millions of dollars have been directed to local populations, empowering them to pursue their development goals while contributing to forest conservation.

They also stated that the overwhelming support from the communities served by these projects stands as a testament to their efficacy and fairness. Additionally, they recognised the vital role indigenous communities play in safeguarding the country’s forests and biodiversity.

Guided by their commitment to the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (UNDRIP), Cambodia ensures that all REDD+ projects comply with social safeguards, including free, prior and informed consent (FPIC) from affected communities, the statement added.

“_France 24_'s portrayal is disrespectful to the years of dialogue and mutual respect that have defined our collaboration with indigenous populations,” it said.

The government remains open to dialogue and constructive feedback and encourages stakeholders to engage transparently and in good faith. However, it rejected unsubstantiated attacks aimed at undermining the integrity of the programmes and tarnishing the nation’s reputation.

The Southern Cardamom REDD+ project, operated by WA, spans 465,839 hectares. It is estimated to reduce CO2 emissions by 3,867,568 tonnes (tCO2e) annually.

The project protects more than 450,000 hectares of endangered forests and preserves 62 globally threatened species.

Two of the six environmental activists arrested in Stung Treng province last week were interviewed by _France 24_ journalists during their investigation into logging. They also interviewed a Chong indigenous family living in the Southern Cardamoms for their report.
