# China’s warships gift and funding naval base in Cambodia: Could it put regional dynamics in choppy waters?

Analysts say the twin moves could be part of a deal to secure China preferential rights to use Ream Naval Base in southern Cambodia. The question is how much access China will have to the military installation, and to what ends.

As a Chinese-funded upgrade of a naval base in Cambodia inches closer to completion, recent confirmation that Beijing will gift two warships to Phnom Penh has stirred further suspense and questions over China’s intent, and the role it wants to play in the region.

Analysts say the overhaul of Ream Naval Base – situated off the Gulf of Thailand in Cambodia’s southwestern Sihanoukville province – would benefit Beijing more as Phnom Penh lacks the military means to fully utilise the enhanced facilities.

The twin moves could be part of a deal to secure China preferential rights to use the military installation, said Dr Abdul Rahman Yaacob, research fellow in the Southeast Asia Programme at the Lowy Institute.
