The National Police issued an October 17 notice explaining that almost 2,000 vehicles with National Police license plates will be removed from its vehicle management registry.

The removals are part of the first phase of new efforts to clean up the incorrect use of plates and follow instructions from the head of government to improve the management of military and police number plates.

The notice, signed by General Sar Thet, National Police chief, removed a total of 1,947 vehicles from the registry. This included 1,139 passenger vehicles, 162 light trucks and 646 motorcycles that were previously listed under Supplementary Table No. 667, dated September 2, 2024, from the Department of Traffic Police and Public Order.

During 30th anniversary celebrations of the Royal Cambodian Army’s Battalion 70 on October 15, Prime Minister Hun Manet instructed both the Ministry of National Defence and the Ministry of Interior to manage the issuance of special license plates more efficiently, in order to prevent traffic complications.

The prime minister also announced that only high-ranking military officers would be authorized to use the license plates from this point forward. 

He urged proper management of both the issuance and use of these plates, warning that misuse could lead to confusion and safety risks. 

“From now on, only senior officers should use these plates. Everyone else can drive without these plates. Misuse creates confusion on the road, and that is problematic," he said.

In line with improving traffic safety, the Prime Minister noted that misused vehicles could pose greater risks on the road, with irresponsible drivers potentially causing accidents that could damage the reputation of legitimate drivers. He stressed the importance of careful management and monitoring of vehicle registrations and licensing.

This traffic regulation initiative comes at a time when Phnom Penh saw an increase in fatal road accidents. According to the Phnom Penh Police, September saw 72 accidents that resulted in 124 casualties, including 29 deaths and 95 injuries. 

The number of accidents decreased by 9 compared to August, a reduction of 11 per cent. However, the number of fatalities increased by 8, a rise of 38 per cent. Meanwhile, the number of injuries dropped by 14, a 13 per cent decrease.

The primary causes of traffic accidents were found to include speeding (25 cases), failure to yield right of way (21 cases), dangerous overtaking (7 cases), reckless driving (6 cases), failure to keep right (4 cases) and driving under the influence (3 cases). The police processed 47 accident cases, forwarding them to the courts for further action.
