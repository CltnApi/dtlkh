More than 4.1 tonnes of batteries have been collected since 2021, considerably mitigating their harmful effects on the environment and human health, such as kidney disease, risks to pregnant women and concerns for foetal health.

According to Khvay Atitya, undersecretary of state and spokesperson for the Ministry of Environment, the ministry has partnered with Ecobatt-Energy Cambodia to collect used batteries. 

The initiative involves the deployment of approximately 200 collection bins in key areas such as public spaces, government institutions, schools, malls, residential areas, restaurants, hotels and petrol stations.

“Since 2021, we have collected over 4.1 tonnes of batteries. We are exploring ways to recover valuable materials from this waste before safely incinerating it in facilities that meet safety standards,” Atitya stated.

Batteries come in various types: alkaline, commonly used in small devices; lithium-ion, found in mobile phones and laptops; and nickel-metal hydride, used in high-power devices such as cameras, sports equipment and electric vehicles.

Research from Ecobatt highlights that old or discarded batteries contain hazardous substances like mercury (Hg), nickel (Ni) and lead (Pb). Improper disposal can release these toxins into the environment, causing severe health and ecological damage.

“Improper battery disposal can lead to contamination, resulting in kidney damage, reduced bone nutrients, nervous system impairments and developmental issues. It also contributes to conditions like cancer, immune system compromise and birth defects in infants,” the company stated.

Ecobatt battery and electronics waste manager Chheuy Bona explained that collected batteries are sorted into categories by type and stored safely in designated warehouses.

“The collection initiative was established to protect the environment, as battery waste poses health risks to children, pregnant women and the elderly,” he said.

Atitya added that recycled batteries can also be processed into agricultural fertilisers after extracting toxic substances. The ministry and the company are studying how residual battery waste can be utilised for agricultural purposes.

“We are researching methods to transform battery waste into fertiliser for crops after removing harmful substances. This project is under development in collaboration with private companies,” he said.

In addition to standard batteries, the company also collects other hazardous electronic waste, such as rechargeable batteries and electrical equipment. These are either refurbished for reuse, dismantled for resource recovery or exported abroad for proper recycling in compliance with international safety standards and the Basel Convention on hazardous waste management. The company also plans to establish a local recycling facility.

Atitya called on the public to dispose of hazardous waste properly, saying, “I encourage citizens not to mix hazardous waste, like standard or rechargeable batteries, with general rubbish. Proper waste separation and reduced plastic use can help keep Cambodia clean for the future.”

According to the ministry, the country produces approximately four million tonnes of waste annually, including over 10,000 tonnes per day nationwide and 5,000 tonnes in Phnom Penh alone.

However, only 50-60 per cent of refuse is collected, with most ending up in landfills. Recycling remains limited, accounting for just 10-15 per cent, contributing to the country’s growing waste problem. Organic waste makes up 60-65 per cent, plastic 20 per cent and electronic waste and other solid materials over 10 per cent.
