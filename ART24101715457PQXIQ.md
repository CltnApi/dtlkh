Participants at the Hong Kong-Asean Summit 2024 were updated on the strong growth potential for tourism between Hong Kong and Cambodia.

Trade between Cambodia and Hong Kong surged 51 per cent from the previous year, with ties between both sides marking a “shining example” of potential for collaboration, according to Prak Phannara, secretary of state for Cambodia’s tourism ministry.

Phnom Penh is also looking at increasing the number of direct flights between Hong Kong and Siem Reap, he added in a 10-minute speech in Hong Kong on Friday.

Phannara was addressing audience members at the Hong Kong-Asean Summit 2024, organised by the South China Morning Post in partnership with the Hong Kong-Asean Foundation and the Our Hong Kong Foundation.
