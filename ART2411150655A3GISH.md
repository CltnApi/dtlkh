Sok Sunnareth, a military official and the father of opposition activist Sorn Dara, has been charged and detained for “illegal possession of drugs” under Article 40 of the Law on Drug Control.

According to a statement released by a spokesperson for Kampong Speu Provincial Court, Sunnareth, 66, was arrested on November 13 in Dak Por village, Svay Kravan commune in the province’s Chbar Mon town.

The case was submitted to the court on November 14 for further legal proceedings.

Court documents stated that he was found in possession of two packages containing methamphetamine, weighing a total of 15.52 grammes, as well as an additional package containing 13.78 grammes of an unidentified substance.

“After deliberation, questioning the suspect and examining the evidence in the case, the investigating judge of the Kampong Speu Provincial Court has decided to place the defendant in pre-trial detention while the investigation is continued, in accordance with legal procedures,” added the spokesperson.

Following Sunnareth’s arrest and detention, Dara, a prominent opposition activist, as well as several former opposition leaders currently living abroad, reacted to the arrests, requesting that the authorities release his father, claiming it was like the traditional Khmer saying, “getting angry with the oxen, but hitting the cart”, which means misdirected anger.

The Royal Army of Cambodia clarified that Kampong Speu Provincial Gendarmerie forces detained Sunnareth in connection with charges of illegal drug possession.

“In regards to the above case, there is no connection with military or political matters; it is strictly a criminal offence related to drugs. The Royal Army of Cambodia will continue to closely monitor this case,” it added.
