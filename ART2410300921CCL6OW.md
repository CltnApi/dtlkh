The National Police called on building site owners across the country to cooperate with fire authorities, warning that legal action will be taken against those who obstruct firefighting operations, leading to serious consequences.

The warning follows a recent fire at a construction site in Srah Chak commune, located in Phnom Penh’s Daun Penh district, on the night of October 27. According to the Fire Prevention and Rescue Department, a security guard responsible for the building allegedly failed to cooperate with police forces during the incident.

The National Police emphasised the need for full cooperation, stating, “Building owners must fully cooperate with the specialised firefighting forces during any incidents to ensure sufficient resources are available to carry out rescue operations, maintaining public safety and order.”

General Neth Vantha, director of the National Police's Department of Fire Prevention, explained that obstructing or failing to support emergency operations can result in criminal penalties.

He said that offenders face imprisonment of up to five years under Article 28 of the 2013 Fire Prevention and Firefighting Law.

“This is the first obstruction case we’ve encountered in 2024, and we are urging all owners to cooperate as required by law,” he said on October 30.

Article 28 of the law stipulates that "intentionally obstructing or creating obstacles to firefighting efforts, leading to severe damage to property, is punishable by imprisonment from two to five years and fines ranging from four million to 10 million riel \[$987-$2,466\]."

The department is continuing to handle the case, Vantha added.

Prom Yorn, chief of the Capital Fire Prevention, Extinguishing and Rescue Office, said the incident arose from a misunderstanding between the security guard and the firefighting team.

He noted that the issue has since been resolved, though he did not provide further details.

Neither Vantha nor Yorn had reports available on fire-related incidents in 2024 to date, as they were out of the office.

The country’s first centralised fire command centre, valued at over $3 million, was inaugurated last week to support fire prevention services.

In the first six months of 2024, there were 738 fires across the country, an increase of 222 compared to the same period in 2023. These incidents resulted in nine deaths, 25 injuries and the destruction of 450 homes and 502 stalls.
