In a celebration of the Kingdom’s proud culture and traditional martial arts, the inaugural “Traditional Khmer Mixed Martial Arts (MMA) Championship” kicked off today at the National Olympic Stadium.

The competition which will run until October 20, has been described as a major step in preserving and promoting Cambodia’s ancient combat traditions, while also modernising them for the global sports stage.

The tournament, officially known as the “Samdech Borvor Thipadei Cup”, is named for the title of the originator of the initiative, Prime Minister Hun Manet. 

It is dedicated to the preservation and development of Khmer martial arts, including Kun Khmer and Kun Lbokator, which were once integral to the might of the ancient Khmer Empire. These martial techniques, developed by Cambodia’s legendary warriors, were not only pivotal for battle but are also considered the foundation of the nation’s rich cultural identity.

During this morning’s opening ceremony, Thong Khon, president of the National Olympic Committee of Committee (NOCC), emphasised the significance of the event, explaining that it is not only a sports competition but also a cultural and historical milestone, one that reflects Cambodia’s proud legacy of a warrior culture. 

“We are proud to honour the warriors and heroes of Cambodia’s ancient past,” he said.

“This event is not just about showcasing the martial arts; it is about understanding the deep roots of Khmer combat traditions that have shaped our country’s history and culture,” he added.

This tournament features over 700 participants, including athletes, coaches, and senior martial arts masters, who will compete in various disciplines ranging from traditional hand-to-hand combat to weaponry and military-style demonstrations.

It has attracted athletes from across the country, including top exponents of several of the Kingdom’s individual fighting styles, as well as mixed martial arts specialists, all vying for top honours under the auspices of the prime minister’s vision.

The tournament’s goal is clear: to bring Cambodia’s ancient fighting styles into the modern age, making them competitive on the international sports scene. The government views this event as a way to gain recognition from the global sports community, with hopes of eventually incorporating Khmer martial arts into international competition standards and Olympic events.

“We aim to modernise and develop Khmer martial arts to the point where they can compete on the world stage. With the Samdech Borvor Thipadei Cup, we are laying the foundation for these sports to one day be recognised internationally,” explained Khon.

The contest will also serve as a platform for researching and documenting ancient Khmer martial arts, many aspects of which remain shrouded in mystery. Documents, stone carvings, and teachings passed down through generations provide glimpses into the strategic genius and physical prowess of ancient Khmer warriors. 

The Ministry of Culture and Fine Arts is working in tandem with scholars and martial arts masters to collect and preserve these invaluable heritage records, both in traditional and digital formats, for future generations.

Cambodia’s National Minister of Education, Youth, and Sports, 

Vath Chamroeun, who serves as president of the Cambodian Martial Arts Federation, expressed his belief that the event represents a pivotal moment in the nation’s sporting and cultural history.

“We have athletes, coaches, officials and historians, all coming together to contribute to a better understanding of our martial arts heritage,” he said.

“This competition is not just about sport; it's a movement to protect and promote a unique and ancient aspect of our culture,” he noted.

Khon shared his hope that the tournament will serve as a catalyst for the ongoing modernisation of Cambodia’s martial arts and inspire younger generations to take pride in their heritage, as well as increasing their recognition on the global stage.

“This event is a clear testament to our commitment to making Khmer martial arts a symbol of national pride and an essential part of the global sporting community,” he said.

With a total of 722 registered participants – 348 male athletes, 77 female athletes, 57 coaches, 170 technical officials, 35 medical specialists and 35 martial arts experts – it is one of the largest martial arts events in Cambodia’s history.

As the tournament continues over the next few days, spectators can expect fierce competition and breathtaking displays of skill, as a deepening respect for Cambodia’s warrior traditions is developed.
