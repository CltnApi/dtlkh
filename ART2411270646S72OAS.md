The prime minister has directed relevant parties to continue resolving disputes related to real estate development projects with flexibility, compromise and mutual understanding to avoid legal action.

During the closing ceremony of the “2024 Annual Review and Strategic Plan Conference of the Ministry of Land Management, Urban Planning and Construction” on November 26, Prime Minister Hun Manet called on stakeholders, including customers, developers, the land management ministry and creditors, to resolve 46 disputes.

“Some developers request the enforcement of the law against clients, while customers demand legal action against the developers. Banks also seek action against those failing to repay loans,” he said.

“I ask, if everyone is punished, who will resolve these issues? This would create more instability. We need to think this through,” he explained.

While some developers have gone bankrupt and others have managed to address issues after partial recovery, the prime minister emphasised that disputes must be resolved amicably to bring an end to the problems.

“Developers, customers, the ministry and creditors must work together to resolve the issues. Among 99 projects, 53 have been resolved, stabilising the situation. If disputes remain unresolved, everyone loses. Enforcing strict legal measures will not help; we all need to collaborate to find solutions,” he stated. 

Land management minister Say Samal noted that the ministry is working to mediate and resolve the remaining disputes with a spirit of mutual understanding. He said this has gradually eased tensions.

Of the 99 projects nationwide, 77 involve 27 boreys (housing developments), four markets and condominiums and 18 land plots, among others.

The minister also revealed that the ministry has addressed 14,919 of 15,960 land-related disputes, with 1,041 cases still pending. These disputes include private land conflicts, state and communal land issues, objections to court or government decisions and politically motivated petitions.

“The resolution of land disputes has significantly reduced political controversy, and the remaining issues no longer pose political controversy,” Samal added.

To enhance citizens’ livelihoods, the government has allocated social land concessions to former armed forces personnel, military families, police along the border and impoverished citizens in 18 target provinces. This includes 487,457 families, the construction of 8,141 homes and the issuance of 654,199 land titles.

The ministry is also implementing the third phase of the Land Allocation for Social and Economic Development (LASED III) project, which supports the government’s social land concession programme. The initiative provides residential and agricultural plots to poor and landless individuals, as well as those with insufficient land, to improve their quality of life.

The project contributes to poverty reduction, fosters entrepreneurship and creates new livelihoods by ensuring land tenure security, housing, social services, infrastructure and access to seeds and livestock.
