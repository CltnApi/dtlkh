The Ministry of Environment has announced a public bidding for the collection of forest by-products resulting from the clearing of the reservoir area for the Stung Tatai Leu Hydropower project in Koh Kong’s Thma Bang district, with an estimated value of over $1.4 million.

The committee overseeing the open auction has informed the public that it will be conducted for the assessed forest resources. This process aims to contribute tax revenue and premiums to the national budget.

A notification issued by the ministry on November 7 stated that the total estimated volume of mixed standing timber exceeds 7,214 steres (cubic metres), valued at $445,142. Additionally, there are 16,805 trees and 8,688 steres of firewood, with an estimated value exceeding $981,011.

“Individuals and legal entities may participate in the auction by completing the application form and meeting the conditions outlined in the bidding document. Those with a history of forest offences or outstanding debts to the state are not permitted to participate,” the notice specified.

Applications for participation can be submitted at the Department of Administration, Planning and Finance under the ministry’s General Directorate of Natural Protected Areas in Phnom Penh’s Chamkarmon district.

The application period is from November 6 to December 5, on working days. The auction will be held on December 6 at 9am at the general directorate.

The announcement also noted that the Anti-Corruption Unit (ACU) and other relevant authorities will be permitted to observe all stages of the bidding process.

Prime Minister Hun Manet presided over the ceremony to close the river flow and launch the construction site for the project in November 2023. The hydropower dam, with a capacity of 150 megawatts, is being constructed by Chinese company Cambodian Upper Tatay Hydropower Co Ltd with an investment of nearly $400 million.

The project uses water from two rivers, the Stung Kep and the Tatay, involving the construction of two dams across both rivers and creating two connected reservoirs linked by an underground water tunnel.
