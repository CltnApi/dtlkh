The “Smile of Cambodia” festival, now in its second edition, has brought the country’s rich cultural heritage to life, celebrating the 20th anniversary of King Norodom Sihamoni’s reign. 

Held in the heart of the Angkor resort in Siem Reap province, the event has attracted both local and international guests eager to witness a grand display of Khmer culture and arts.

This year’s event, running from October 29-30, marks a significant moment in Cambodia's journey toward a brighter tourism future, especially as the nation emerges from a downturn in visitor numbers due to the Covid-19 pandemic. 

Mao Chamnan, president of the Khmer Artists Association (KAA), emphasised that the celebration is not only a tribute to the King’s coronation, but also an ambitious step toward reinvigorating the tourism sector.

The festival opened on October 29 with a ceremony that included traditional Khmer dance and a multicultural art exhibition, showcasing the nation’s diversity and artistic depth.

The afternoon parade of Angkorian kings brought history to life, drawing hundreds of renowned artists and spectators to honour the country’s storied past. 

Chamnan noted the overwhelming turnout and expressed gratitude for the “unified mission” behind the event.

“We continue to work together to promote arts, culture and tourism in Cambodia,” said Chamnan during the opening ceremony. 

The “Smile of Cambodia” festival has seen a remarkable increase in participation, with an estimated 750 to 800 artists volunteering this year – a 500-person increase from initial projections. 

KAA advisor Seth Kimsoeun remarked on the impressive turnout, noting that the crowd’s enthusiasm and energy far surpassed what could be captured on camera.

"When the camera captures a wide view, it doesn’t show the full crowd," he told _The Post_. "But in person, we saw large numbers of people in the morning, afternoon and evening. They eagerly came to see the performances and the Angkorian king parade, especially due to the extensive promotion of the event during this national holiday."

According to the National Bank of Cambodia (NBC), 3.1 million foreign tourists visited the country in the first half of 2024, generating $1.7 billion in revenue. Supplied

As Cambodia looks toward the future with a vision of obtaining upper-middle-income status by 2030 and high-income status by 2050, the festival plays a vital role in spotlighting the nation’s potential as a global cultural destination. 

Chamnan pointed out that events like these align with the government’s long-term tourism goals and help dispel negative stereotypes, presenting the nation as a vibrant, forward-looking destination.

The event aims to boost year-end visitor numbers and prepare for a robust 2025 tourism season. 

“Tourism has been a cornerstone of Cambodia’s economy, but the sector has struggled in recent years,” Chamnan stated. “The decline calls for all of us to act as ‘doctors’ to restore and rejuvenate this vital industry.”

According to the National Bank of Cambodia (NBC), 3.1 million foreign tourists visited the country in the first half of 2024, generating $1.7 billion in revenue – a 7 per cent increase from last year’s figures.

Chamnan stressed the importance of continuously adapting Cambodia’s tourism offerings to meet international expectations and further strengthen this essential economic pillar.

This year’s “Smile of Cambodia” also explores modern avenues to expand the global audience for Khmer culture. 

Chamnan highlighted the role of digital technology, describing it as “an open sky for boundless promotion”. 

She encouraged young people to embrace their heritage and showcase it to the world, much as Princess Indra Devi did, famously praising Cambodia as “equal to the sky”.

The festival’s final day included a tasting fair with authentic Khmer food, cakes, drinks, live performances and a mini-concert – all designed to give visitors an immersive experience of Cambodian culture. 

The event’s impact resonates beyond just its attendees, projecting an image of a resilient, culturally rich Cambodia that is ready to welcome the world.

Chamnan closed her address with a call for collective pride and unity, encouraging the country’s youth to take ownership of their culture and help redefine its global image. 

“These opportunities allow us to widely share and promote Cambodian arts and culture,” she said. “Let us come together, think collectively, and spread the beauty of Khmer cultural arts to all corners of the world.”

The festival stands as a powerful testament to the country’s enduring spirit, cultural legacy and determination to reestablish itself on the world tourism map.
