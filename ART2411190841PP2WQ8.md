# Femme de la Guerre: French army engineering graduate inspires women to pursue military dreams

As more and more Khmer women embrace non-traditional roles and tackle challenges that were once reserved for men, the Kingdom is witnessing the rise of a new generation. From entrepreneurs to underwater demining technicians, women are stepping up, taking on some of the toughest paths available, and succeeding.

Bun Cheavatey is a prime example of this new, empowered generation.

With her tall stature and striking features, Cheavatey could have easily pursued a more conventional path. However, she chose a different route, opting for a challenging career in the military, and ultimately qualifying as a combat engineer at one of Europe’s toughest military academies.

Lieutenant Cheavatey graduated from the Army Engineering School (Ecole du Genie) in France last August and is currently working in the Department of International Relations at the Ministry of National Defence.

Born in Battambang province, she is the eldest of three siblings. Unlike many women who aspire to work in comfortable, air-conditioned offices, her goal was always to follow in the footsteps of her father, a career soldier.

**A family tradition of service**

Squared away in her dark green dress uniform, the 24-year-old told _The Post_, “My dream career has always been to wear the Kingdom’s uniform – I love it. My father is a soldier, and when I was a little girl and I saw him in his uniform, I thought he looked handsome and proud. That's when I started to fall in love with the idea of a career in the military.”

What Vatey remembers most is her father's dedication to his important role. Although this meant he sometimes did not have much time for his family, his devotion to the country made her proud to follow in his footsteps.

She gave up other career opportunities to pursue her dream.

“In 2017, I graduated from high school. Before joining the army, I passed an exam and had already studied a two-month pedagogical course to be a primary school teacher. I also applied for a military Bachelor’s Degree programme. When I knew I passed the latter, without hesitation, I chose to study for the military degree,” she recalled.

Initially, Vatey’s decision met with some opposition from her family, who believed women should choose jobs that do not require serious physical effort. 

“At first, it was difficult to convince them because Mom and Dad did not want any of us to join the armed forces,” she said. “Military training is hard, and it requires a lot of physical effort and personal time.”

Despite receiving support from most of her friends, Vatey often had to answer to people who could not understand why she chose such a physically challenging career.

“Some people questioned why I didn’t study to be a teacher and have an easier life. But I love having an adventurous career. I like parachute jumping, physical training and experiencing new things," she explained.

**Experiencing boot camp**

So, at 18, she began training at the Active Military Academy in Kampong Speu province. The course included military science, general knowledge, political science and social sciences. Specialist programmes included on-site and in-class physical training. After four years of training, she obtained a bachelor's degree in Military Science.

“The physical training was difficult. As women, we have to work a little harder than men because we are not as strong,” she said. 

“For the first three months, we did not go out on weekends; we stayed in the military compound for additional training,” she added.

She practiced various sports, including swimming, sprinting, and parachuting and endured long marches which sometimes lasted for several nights in a row, an unforgettable experience. 

“What I remember most was an exercise in Kampong Cham. We marched for three nights, carrying our personal weapon and a heavy rucksack and not sleeping until dawn,” she said.

“It was very difficult, but I never thought of giving up,” she added.

In addition to strict military discipline and specialised classes, including parachute training at the Special Forces Command, Vatey began studying French in 2019, under the auspices of the Cambodian and French militaries. 

“They sent a French language instructor to teach us. I was aware that some of the older students had studied abroad, and I was encouraged to learn French so I could take advantage of any opportunities that might present themselves,” she said.

After graduating from the Kampong Speu academy in 2022, Vatey moved to Phnom Penh, where she was posted at the International Relations Department of the Ministry of National Defence. After serving there for a year, she heard about the possibility of continuing her combat engineering training in France through an international cooperation programme.

“There were about eight candidates, and we each had a face-to-face interview with the head of cooperation,” she said. 

**European experience**

Thanks to her fluency in French and her studies as the language diplomat at the Institut Français, she was selected to attend a combat engineering course at the Ecole du Genie School of Engineering in Angers, France. 

“Out of 103 students, I was the only one from Cambodia. I felt very proud to represent the Kingdom,” she said.

The one-year course focused on combat engineering skills, including military tactics, explosive ordnance clearance (EOC), shooting, trapping and operating the heavy machinery and military vehicles used in engineering. She also mastered the SCORPION SICS combat information system, a cutting-edge tool which the French military uses to link its units in modern combined arms warfare.

“Combat engineering is a skill that supports infantry in combat. For example, building trenches is very important,” she explained.

She described the advanced western-style training as exciting and expressed her pride at overcoming gender, cultural and physical challenges.

“I could hardly believe I had come this far,” she said. “In France, the exercises felt like real combat, with live fire, main battle tanks and we were working alongside other armoured vehicles.”

After graduating in August, Vatey returned to her post at the international relations department. She wants to encourage more women in the defence sector to pursue their dream careers. 

“\[In terms of the military\] Women can do more than communication and protocol work. There are a lot of tasks that women can do just as well as men,” she said.

After completing her combat engineering training, Lieutenant Cheavatey set herself a longer-term goal. 

“My career goal is to pursue a degree in defence in France at The War College (Ecole de Guerre) and continue strengthening cooperation between the French and Cambodian militaries,” she explained.

“I would like to thank the leadership at all levels, especially Lieutenant General Phat Vibol Sopheak, for giving me and my fellow soldiers the opportunity and encouragement to study and strengthen our careers,” she said.

Vatey also thanked the French Defence Mission in Cambodia for providing French language courses, as well as her family, for their unwavering support. 

“Finally, thank you to my family, Mom and Dad, who are my main motivation. My parents always said they had no capital for me, but I always replied that they gave me the life I have today,” she said.
