# Art with heart: Autistic children’s artwork helps fund specialised school

In an inspiring display of love and determination, parents of autistic children have come together to support their young ones’ artistic endeavours, with all proceeds going toward the construction of a new 10-storey school designed specifically for children affected by the condition. 

This heartfelt initiative is part of a broader effort to raise awareness and funds for a project to build the Growing Special Education School (GSES), which promises to provide an inclusive and supportive environment for these youth.

One of the campaign's proudest moments comes from Phen Lyna, the mother of 12-year-old Pey, who has autism.

Pey’s artwork, a dazzling depiction of three hearts crafted from painted rice, has captured the hearts of many. 

Speaking about her daughter’s artwork, Lyna shared, “I’m so proud of her for creating such a beautiful piece. It’s a reminder of how much potential our children have. When I saw the hearts, I thought, ‘These are her dreams shining through.’”

Lyna has also contributed to the cause in her own way by donating $25 toward the building of the school. 

“I believe in this project, and I want to show my support. It’s not just about buying her artwork, but helping to create a future for all children like Pey,” Lyna added.

Creating art is not an easy task for children with autism, and it requires great patience and guidance. 

Yin Reaksmey, head teacher of the Parrot Classroom at GSES, shared insights into the challenges of training these children to produce artwork. 

"Every piece takes time. For one child to complete a single piece of art, it takes about a week of effort," she said. 

"Our students often need extra help from their teachers to express themselves through their work. It's a labour of love, but the results are truly inspiring."

Among the 313 students with autism at the school, only about 50 were selected to participate in the art project, as they were able to engage in the creative process. 

The students, guided by their dedicated teachers, worked hard to produce paintings and drawings that would eventually be sold to raise funds for the new school building.

While many art pieces were sold during the campaign, it was the parents who remained the most committed supporters of their children’s artwork. 

“The parents are the driving force behind this project. They not only bought their own children’s art but also encouraged others to contribute. It’s heartwarming to see the love and dedication they have for their children, and the funds raised will go directly into building a new, state-of-the-art school,” said GSES founder and coordinator Phok Many.

“Dr. Mengly J. Quach has also pledged his support, contributing three million riel \[$745\] to the project. The school also signed a memorandum of understanding with Yeo's Cambodia for a charity project to construct a modern educational facility for autistic children,” said Many.

A charity concert, dubbed _A Symphony of Hope_, was held recently to support the cause, as part of a larger fundraising initiative. It was a stunning success and raised additional funds for the school.

The new building, once completed, will provide a comprehensive and tailored learning environment for children with autism. 

It will feature specialised classrooms, therapy rooms and recreational spaces designed to support the unique needs of the students, ensuring that they receive the best possible education and care.

For Lyna, this project is not just about the future of her daughter, but about creating opportunities for all children with autism. 

“I believe that every child, regardless of their condition, deserves a chance to shine,” she said. “This school will make sure they have that chance.”
