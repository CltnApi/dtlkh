Cambodia has called upon all developed countries, the highest greenhouse gas emitters, to enhance their financial commitment to addressing climate change by establishing ambitious targets that exceed $100 billion per year. 

The message was shared by Minister of Environment Eang Sophalleth, who is heading the Cambodian delegation to the 29th UN Climate Change Conference, known as COP29. He addressed the UNFCCC Secretariat in Baku, Azerbaijan, on November 19.

In addition, he suggested that a simplified modality for direct access to the Green Climate Fund (GCF) should be operationalised.

“Cambodia is strongly committed to both national and international efforts to meet the targets set forth in the Paris Agreement on Climate Change,” he said. 

“Although Cambodia is a low greenhouse gas emitter country, it faces dire risk from climate-induced impacts such as flooding, heatwaves, land degradation and heightened vulnerability to the adverse impacts of climate change,” he added.

In response to the global climate crisis, Cambodia has set high ambitious pledges in the 2020 Updated Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) and is committed to achieving carbon neutrality by 2050. 

In support of a holistic approach to the implementation of the Paris Agreement, the Cambodian government’s Circular Strategy for Environment 2023-2028 has streamlined the climate agenda into Cambodia's Sustainable Development Goals, as well as other national development priorities, explained a November 19 statement from the environment ministry.

Sophalleth also informed the conference about the success of Cambodia’s anti-plastic campaign, explaining that more than 9.7 million people from all walks of life – more than half of the Kingdom’s population – are participating and have committed to eliminating the use of plastic bags and cleaning up plastic waste from public spaces.

In parallel, the Kingdom is also running a campaign to “Green Cambodia” by planting over one million trees in the first year alone and increasing this annually to expand forest cover towards carbon neutrality by 2050.

Cambodia has also adopted a new Article 6 Operations Manual and is actively working to expand carbon market opportunities in six core sectors: energy, industry, solvents, agriculture, forestry and waste.

“There is an urgent need for bold action for all but must ensure climate finance to implement Nationally Determined Contributions (NDC) and Long-Term Strategies for Parties under LDC and SIDS categories,” the minister implored.

“The world is looking forward to hearing the concrete results at this COP29 that will deliver to Parties to ensure sustainable economic development and social safeguard for communities suffering from and relentlessly fighting against the climate crisis,” he added.

COP29, which runs from November 11 to 22, brings together global leaders to address climate challenges, including limiting the global temperature rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius, helping vulnerable communities to adapt to the changing climate and achieve net-zero emissions by 2050.

The minister also met with Land Use, Forests and Ecosystems Senior Specialist of the GCF Benedict Augustine Vickers. 

Vickers urged Cambodia to prepare documents and procedures to become an accredited entity to receive direct funding for climate change action, according to the environment ministry.
