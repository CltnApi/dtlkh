# First hatchling in captivity offers hope for Cambodia’s endangered Black Marsh Turtle

The first Black Marsh Turtle hatched in captivity in Cambodia is being carefully nurtured by conservationists until it can be released back into the wild as part of a plan to rebuild the population of the endangered reptile.

The baby turtle hatched in late May at the Angkor Centre for Conservation of Biodiversity (ACCB), after its parents were rescued from the black market.

The tiny reptile, just 6 cm (2 inches) long and weighing around 40 grams (1.4 ounce), is expected to stay in the sanctuary until it is big enough to be less vulnerable to its natural predators, ACCB country director Christel Griffioen said.
