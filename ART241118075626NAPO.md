The Cambodian women's national football team has announced its final 23-player roster for the upcoming 2024 AFF Women’s Cup, which will take place in Laos from November 23 to 29. The Monday November 18 announcement followed a series of training and selection camps, overseen by the Cambodian Football Federation (CFF).

The squad draws players from several domestic sides: seven from Phnom Penh Crown, six from Vishaka FC, four from Nagaworld, three from Siem Reap FC, two from Boeung Ket FC and one notable addition – Canadian-Cambodian defender Chhiv Selena, who played a role in the Kingdom’s historic performance at the 2023 SEA Games, when the under-rated women’s squad earned a place in the bronze medal playoffs, after a stellar series of performances in their pool matches.

The selection of the 23 followed a rigorous process which began when 30 hopefuls were called up for trials on November 7. The team is now ready for the tournament, and will compete in Group B alongside Malaysia and Indonesia. Meanwhile, Group A features host nation Laos, Singapore and Timor-Leste.

One notable absence from the squad this time around is Melania Joy Hoekstra, a key defender who helped propel Cambodia to the semifinals of the 2023 SEA Games, making history for the national team.

Hoekstra, who plays for Taiwan’s Kaohsiung Attackers, was unable to join the team due to her club commitments. Her season runs through November 23, which overlaps with this year’s Women’s Cup. This left fans disappointed, as many had hoped to see her return to the national fold.

In a heartfelt message delivered via social media, Hoekstra expressed her sadness over missing the tournament.

“I am truly disappointed to announce that I will not be able to join the Cambodian Women's National Team for the AFF Women's Cup qualifying matches. My season with the Kaohsiung Attackers runs until November 23, and I simply cannot leave before the FIFA window opens. I hope to return to play for Cambodia in 2025. Best of luck to the selected players, and I will be cheering you on. Soksok Cambodia!” she wrote.

Hoekstra was a pivotal figure in Cambodia’s historic SEA Games run in 2023, where her defensive prowess helped the team secure second place in Group B. The women triumphed over Laos (2-0) and Singapore (1-0) but suffered a 3-0 loss to Thailand, setting up a clash against Vietnam in the semifinals.

Although they went on to lose 4-0 to Vietnam and then 6-0 to Thailand in the bronze medal match, their achievement of reaching the semi-finals for the first time in the competition’s history was a monumental milestone for Cambodian women's football.

While her absence is a blow, the team remains focused on making an impact in the AFF Cup, and fans are hopeful that the squad will continue to build on its momentum from the SEA Games.
