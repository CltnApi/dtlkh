Saly Oumoeut, leader of the Kingdom’s national water jet racing team, has hailed the team’s incredible performance at round 2 of the 2024 Water Jet World Series (WGP1), which just concluded in Arizona, the US.

Cambodian riders earned an impressive 6 gold, 3 silver and 1 bronze medal. This extraordinary performance has garnered global attention, breaking records and showcasing the Kingdom’s growing prominence in the sport.

Reflecting on his team's success, Oumoeut emphasised the significance of the results, especially the 6 golds, which surpassed the previous year's achievements of 4 gold, 1 silver, and 5 other placings. He described the accomplishment as groundbreaking, stating that it has sent shockwaves around the world.

“This is the third year I’ve led the team to the US, and this year, we’ve achieved something truly remarkable. With just five team members, we managed to win 6 gold medals, 3 silver and 1 bronze. This result is almost unbelievable – there are few countries that could achieve this level of success,” he said, via a video message.

Oumoeut also highlighted the performance of his younger brother, Saly Filin, who claimed 4 gold medals and 2 silver, surpassing his previous results. This achievement helped the Cambodian team solidify their place on the global water jet sports map.

Other team members Kay Vansiden and Min Mustan also contributed to the gold medal haul, with Oumoeut himself securing a gold and a bronze, playing a crucial role in the historic victory.

“We came here with the hearts of Cambodians, determined to show the world that, despite our small size, Cambodia has powerful athletes. We’re here to put Cambodia on the global map, and especially to show the world that we can excel in international sports,” Oumoeut proudly declared.

He also credited the support of both former Prime Minister Hun Sen and current Prime Minister Hun Manet, who have contributed to peace and stability, fostering growth in all sectors, including sports.

“I am proud to be a Cambodian athlete, continuing the legacy of our ancestors and contributing to our country's international recognition,” he added.

He also addressed the challenges of financing, especially when sending athletes abroad. He called for increased private sector support to ensure that Cambodian athletes can continue to thrive on the world stage and bring further growth to the sport in the country.

Looking to the future, Oumoeut expressed his desire to bring the Water Jet World Series home to the Kingdom.

 “Cambodia has huge potential in water jet sports,” he said.

“We’ve consistently won gold medals on the international stage, whether in Europe, the US or Asia. I hope local companies will step up to help attract tourists to Cambodia through this exciting sport,” he added.

His ultimate vision is to host a major international event in the Kingdom, inviting athletes from 30 to 40 countries to compete and raise Cambodia’s profile as a hub for world-class water jet competitions. 

“This is our chance to show the world just how capable and competitive Cambodia is,” Oumoeut explained.
