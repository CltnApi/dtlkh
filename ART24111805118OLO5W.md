The General Department of Immigration (GDI) has deported 23 Vietnamese nationals, including seven women, for residing illegally in Cambodia and working without the correct documentation.

The deportations were carried out on November 15 at the Trapeang Phlong International Border Gate Police Station in Tbong Khmum Province.

“20 individuals (including six women) were apprehended by the Oddar Meanchey provincial police, while the remaining three (one woman) were detained by the police in Siem Reap province,” said a GDI statement.

All were found residing and working in Cambodia without valid visas.

According to a GDI report, on June 19, 33 Vietnamese nationals were deported from Cambodia in connection with entering the Kingdom illegally to reside and work.

In 2021, Cambodia deported 3,594 foreigners from 43 nationalities, with Vietnamese nationals comprising a significant portion of those expelled.
