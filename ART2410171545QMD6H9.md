The second edition of the national Khmer dictation competition, themed “Angkor Writing”, will be held on Sunday, January 19, 2025 at the western causeway of the iconic Angkor Wat Temple. 

This year, the competition introduces a key change by dividing participants into two age groups: those 18 years old or younger and those 19 years and older.

According to Lim Bunhok, secretary of state at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation, there is no minimum age requirement for the younger group, ensuring inclusivity for all who are confident in their Khmer writing skills.

“We want to encourage everyone who believes they can write in Khmer to participate. For the second group, there’s no upper age limit, making this event open to people of all ages,” Bunhok emphasised during an October 16 press conference.

Applications for the competition are being accepted from October 16 through the end of December 2024. 

The event is being organised by the foreign ministry in collaboration with the Ministry of Education, Youth and Sport, the Ministry of Culture and Fine Arts and the Ministry of Tourism. 

While these ministries are supporting the event, there is no official budget allocated for the contest. To help cover some costs, such as T-shirts, participants are asked to contribute 20,000 riel ($5).

The technical aspects of the competition are being overseen by the education ministry.

Hour Chhun Kry, director-general of the ministry’s general education department, assured that all preparations are in place.

“We have set up the technical specifications, and we’re ready to proceed when the day comes,” he said.

The competition aims to surpass 2023’s turnout of 700 contestants, with a target of 1,000 to 1,500. 

Last year’s event, which also took place on the majestic causeway of Angkor Wat, celebrated the Kingdom’s literary heritage under the theme “Angkor Khmer Civilisation”.

The contest drew participants as young as seven and as old as 67, with prizes ranging from cash awards to luxury hotel stays. 

Cheng Ratana, a 28-year-old, took home the top prize after making only two errors in his dictation.

For the second edition, the foreign ministry will continue to oversee the event’s theme, while the education ministry ensures the technical accuracy of the dictation texts and the culture ministry coordinates the overall presentation of the competition.

After opening the event last year, culture minister Phoeurng Sackona dictated the chosen texts to the contestants.

“The Cambodian people have consistently worked to preserve our national literature, from its inception until the French colonial period, when some sought to convert it to the Latin alphabet,” she said.

“Our people, including the monks, have long strived to safeguard the written Khmer language. It is a valuable part of our national identity. As long as it is promoted, the essence and script of the nation endure,” she added.

This year’s theme reinforces the cultural significance of the Khmer alphabet and serves as an opportunity for all Cambodians to reconnect with their literary heritage. 

As Angkor Wat – the heart of Cambodia’s history – hosts the second dictation contest, the country continues to foster a deeper appreciation for the language that has carried its stories for centuries.
