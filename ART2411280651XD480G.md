Over 270 young people gathered in Phnom Penh on November 23 for the “Youth Light Up Talk”, an event that highlighted the stories of youth from marginalised communities. 

The forum, led by social responsibility group Youth Ambassadors and funded by USAID Cambodia Advancing Youth Leadership (AYL), provided a platform for young voices often overlooked in mainstream discussions about youth leadership and civic engagement.

Held under the theme “Empower Youth Leaders, Light Up Marginalised Voices”, the event aimed to broaden the perspectives of youth with disabilities, the LGBTQI+ community and indigenous youth. 

The gathering was attended by key figures, including Chek Lim, deputy director of the Directorate of Youth at the Ministry of Education, Youth and Sport, Tom White, USAID Cambodia director for democracy and governance, and Nicole Johnson, chief of party for AYL.

In her opening remarks, Johnson spoke about the barriers many young people face in fully participating in youth development activities and civic life, including stigma, discrimination and social or physical obstacles. 

However, she emphasised that young people themselves are crucial to overcoming these challenges. 

“We believe that the youth are critical actors to address these issues; that youth are able to understand and create new and innovative solutions to inequality,” Johnson stated.

The event featured a series of compelling speeches by young representatives from different communities, each of whom shared their personal experiences and the challenges they have faced.

Despite facing societal barriers, she has pursued her dreams and become a role model for others. 

“Even with a disability, let us not limit our potential,” she said, encouraging youth to nurture their mental health and pursue self-development. “We shall achieve our future aspirations.”

Leap, a youth advocate from the Jaray indigenous community, spoke passionately about the importance of education for young girls in her village. 

She shared how early marriage, domestic violence and limited access to education continue to hinder the opportunities available to young women in her community. 

“I am committed to using my education to empower my community and advocate for social change,” Leap stated, urging other young girls to pursue their dreams despite the challenges they face.

Sokcheat, a member of the LGBTQI+ community, reflected on their personal journey of embracing their identity and fighting for LGBTQI+ rights. 

Their speech highlighted the importance of acceptance and the need to challenge societal norms. 

“We are all unique, and our differences should be celebrated, not discriminated against,” Sokcheat said.

Throughout the event, the audience was reminded of the importance of inclusivity and the role young people play in shaping a more equitable society. 

Tum Sotheary, lead of the Youth Ambassadors Board, emphasised that youth are not just the leaders of tomorrow – they are the leaders of today. 

“Youth engagement is key to shaping visionary leaders who will drive inclusive progress,” Sotheary said. “The unwavering passion and dedication of the Youth Ambassadors and volunteers are truly inspiring.”

White also shared his thoughts on the power of youth in fostering social change.

“At USAID, we believe in the power of youth,” he said. “You are at the heart of development, driving change in your communities and shaping the future. That’s why we work to build your skills, create opportunities and amplify your voices in decisions that impact your lives.”

As the “Youth Light Up Talk” came to a close, participants left with renewed energy to continue advocating for the issues that matter most to them. 

The event not only provided a platform for sharing marginalised voices but also encouraged action toward a more inclusive and empathetic society.

The Youth Ambassadors, an organisation initiated by Pact Cambodia under USAID’s Women Entrepreneurs Act (WE Act) project in 2020, continue to lead efforts to empower youth leadership and promote inclusive civic engagement. 

Today, the organisation operates as an independent youth-led group, with a mission to enable young people to lead their own projects and drive awareness on socioeconomic rights.
