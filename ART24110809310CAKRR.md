# Behind the lens: Dararith capturing more than hearts

Tiv Dararith, a Cambodian long-distance cyclist and content creator, is undertaking an epic bicycle ride from the Kingdom to Europe to raise funds for medical care for Cambodian children. His journey has captured the hearts of thousands already, with many expressing their pride at what he has achieved so far.

With each pedal stroke, he’s not only covering vast distances, but also capturing the beauty and challenges of his surroundings.

Currently cycling through India, Dararith has shared tales from his adventure, a journey that’s as much about the art of photography as it is about traversing the rugged landscapes between continents.

In one striking photograph, seen above, he can be seen pedalling his bicycle across a rocky stream, framed by the lush, green hillsides of a remote mountain pass. 

The image, though appearing effortless, belies the meticulous work that went into capturing it. 

The striking image was taken with a timed shot – a technique that requires not only impeccable timing but also a practiced eye for composition. 

Having cycled through vast swathes of Cambodia, Laos, Thailand, and Nepal already, Dararith’s journey is a testament to the power of perseverance and purpose. 

In the past few months, he’s travelled through dense forests, daunting valleys and challenging bad weather, all while documenting his experiences with a camera, creating visuals that seem almost effortless. 

However, as Dararith explains, achieving these captivating shots demanded careful planning and dedication.

“With my travel experience from last year, where I cycled through Southeast Asia and Europe, I became more proficient in travel photography. Before I reach any new location, I consider what type of shots I want and make notes in my notebook,” he told The Post.

Capturing a stunning self-portrait on a bicycle amid an idyllic landscape is more than a simple click. 

It involves meticulous setup, from mounting the camera on a tripod to envisioning the scene he wants to portray, then cycling to a precise spot to take the shot.

While some of the heavy lifting is done by the enchanting beauty of nature and culture, they are also a result of the skillsets Dararith has honed, through watching films, documentaries and YouTube tutorials on photography techniques. 

“Some shots happen by luck – without that luck, there’s no magic, like cycling down a hill at sunset or capturing a smile from a child,” he explained. 

His images reflect more than scenes; they capture emotions and fleeting moments that are often difficult to recreate.

The journey has not been without its challenges, especially in Nepal, where an unexpected detour forced Dararith to navigate some of the roughest terrains he’s ever encountered. 

The roads in the country’s step mountain passes, damaged and muddy due to the rainy season, added significant strain.

“The road conditions in Nepal are awful for cyclists. There are damaged roads almost everywhere,” he remarked. Despite this, he was undeterred by the daunting obstacles.

Nepal’s harsh conditions brought Dararith’s skills as both a cyclist and a photographer to the forefront. 

The journey to Pokhara, which took three exhausting days to cover only 200 kilometres, rewarded him with one of the most picturesque landscapes he had ever seen.

“It was not easy to ride my bike from Kathmandu to Pokhara,” he recalled. But the breathtaking scenery, including views of the Annapurna Mountain range, justified the gruelling journey.

From Pokhara, Dararith took on a challenging route to Muktinath Temple through the rugged Mustang District. 

Navigating steep, narrow, cliffside paths from Jomsom to Muktinath in freezing temperatures, he called it “the most challenging road I’ve ever ridden”.

His journey worsened when his bike’s rear rack broke under the weight of his gear, leaving him stranded. Fortunately, a passing tour bus driver helped him return safely to Pokhara.

But this setback did not deter Dararith. His determination is fuelled by a greater purpose: to raise $250,000 for the Angkor Hospital for Children, commemorating the hospital's 25th anniversary and its mission to help Cambodian children battling serious illnesses. 

“I must persevere, even if it means traversing hundreds of mountains and rivers filled with numerous dangers and obstacles, because I am doing this to benefit many Cambodian children in hospitals,” he explained.

Every image he shares is a tribute to this mission. His photography not only showcases his journey but also sheds light on the lives and landscapes of the regions he traverses.

From capturing local traditions to documenting the warmth of strangers he meets along the way, Dararith’s work brings Cambodian culture to an international audience, while capturing the essence of each destination.
