In a groundbreaking initiative to combat gender-based violence (GBV) across Cambodia, the UN Population Fund (UNFPA), with funding from the Wesley Zaidan Foundation, has partnered with the Ministry of Women’s Affairs and Child Helpline Cambodia (CHC) to launch the “GBV Safe App – (Our Safety App)”.

The mobile application, designed to offer critical resources and support services to women and girls experiencing harassment, abuse or violence, will officially launch on November 25, marking the beginning of the 16 Days of Activism against Gender-Based Violence campaign.

According to UNFPA Cambodia, the app provides “vital resources and direct access to information, support, and services on harassment, abuse and violence for women and girls who are most at risk”. 

With features such as a secure, confidential platform, legal assistance links and educational resources on GBV, the app aims to connect high-risk populations, such as students, factory workers and urban communities, with life-saving services. 

The app is available now for Android users on the Google Play Store, with iOS access expected soon on the Apple App Store.

The collaborative effort aligns with UN Sustainable Development Goals on health, well-being, and gender equality, particularly as GBV remains one of the world’s most pressing human rights violations.

In Cambodia, UNFPA has been focusing on advancing sexual and reproductive health and family planning to address critical needs among women and girls. 

As of 2024, the contraceptive prevalence rate among women aged 15-49 was 43 per cent for any method and 33 per cent for modern methods, with higher usage rates observed among married women. 

However, despite progress, there remains a 7 per cent unmet need for family planning, highlighting the need for further access to contraceptive resources.

Cambodia’s maternal health infrastructure shows promise, with 99 per cent of births attended by skilled health personnel, though the maternal mortality ratio remains high, at 218 deaths per 100,000 live births​.

UNFPA's work in Cambodia also includes ensuring access to comprehensive sexual and reproductive health information and education, supported by national laws and regulations with a 98 per cent guarantee of access in 2022. 

By providing resources for family planning and maternal health, UNFPA seeks to enhance the well-being and autonomy of Cambodian women and girls, contributing to gender equality and sustainable development in the region.

**A united initiative for women’s safety**

The development of the GBV app began in early 2022, through a partnership between UNFPA and Wesley Zaidan.

“Women and girls’ safety, free from harassment and violence, remains our top priority,” said Golden Mulilo, UNFPA representative in Cambodia. 

“We believe that this innovative digital technology platform will protect vulnerable women and girls from all forms of violence in Cambodia,” he added.

Hikari Kokai, country director of Japan-based Wesley Zaidan, highlighted the project's significance: “Empowering women means enabling them to use their gifts with confidence, joy and freedom from fear.”

“This project promotes the empowerment of women and girls in Cambodia and contributes to the elimination of gender-based violence in Asia and globally,” she added.

GBV disproportionately affects women and girls and is deeply rooted in gender inequality, significantly undermining women’s health, autonomy and societal participation. 

An estimated 30 per cent of Cambodian women have experienced some form of intimate partner violence in their lifetime, with the pandemic exacerbating this prevalence.

The new app provides a critical bridge between these women and the services they need, an area where service gaps still exist.

Currently, only 24 per cent of survivors can access formal support, underscoring the urgent need for a more accessible support platform.

Through its features, the app educates users on recognising GBV, offers quick links to legal assistance, and provides a confidential space for those seeking immediate help. 

“It serves as an educational and emergency tool, connecting users with information on GBV and essential support services,” explained UNFPA Cambodia.

**Expanding impact through awareness**

Women’s ministry and Child Helpline Cambodia, in partnership with UNFPA, have launched an awareness campaign to engage students, factory workers, and other high-risk groups, reaching over two million people through social media channels.

By actively encouraging downloads of the app – and aiming for 1,500 active users within four months – the campaign seeks to foster greater understanding of GBV issues and expand access to essential support resources. 

This feedback from users will enable the app’s developers to refine its functionality, ensuring it meets the diverse needs of at-risk women across Cambodia.

“Together, we are making it easier for women to access the information, support and services they need through the GBV Safe App,” said a representative from UNFPA Cambodia. 

As the UN agency focused on sexual and reproductive health, UNFPA is dedicated to creating a world where every pregnancy is wanted, every childbirth is safe and every young person can reach their potential without facing the threat of violence.
