The Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries has distributed over 467 tonnes of rice seeds to more than 4,000 farming families affected by floods in seven districts and one town in Kampong Thom province. The distribution is aimed at helping them replant and recover their crops.

Provincial agriculture department director Pen Vannarith explained that the seeds provided are of the OM 5451 variety, a short-term, non-seasonal rice.

"After receiving the rice seeds, farmers can immediately start planting during this receding water season. The rice will be ready for harvest in about three months. Wherever there is a water source, replanting can be done. In our province, we farm during both the rainy and dry seasons," he told _The Post_ on Monday, October 21.

He added that rice production in the province this year has exceeded the target, reaching over 220,000 hectares, 103 per cent of the planned cultivation area.

Kampong Thom was the hardest hit by flash floods during the first wave, which destroyed over 3,000 hectares of crops out of more than 6,000 hectares affected as of early August.

During distribution on October 18, agriculture minister Dith Tina advised farmers to collaborate and plan ahead, taking into account the guidance of relevant ministries on weather forecasts and climate change to mitigate potential challenges and avoid farming in high-risk areas.

The minister emphasised that the government's goal is to ensure food security and economic efficiency for farmers, ensuring they have enough to eat and a decent income. He said the government has consistently provided assistance to help farmers recover from disasters.

Additionally, the government has implemented priority policies to stabilise agricultural prices, reduce production costs, deploy agricultural officials to communes and districts and establish modern agricultural communities to provide technical support, information and solutions to farming-related challenges. 

These efforts aim to increase agricultural productivity and improve livelihoods, ensuring food security and safety.

The ministry maintains a reserve of 2,000 tonnes of pure seed and an additional 3,000 tonnes of cash reserves to assist affected farmers annually. More than 600 tonnes of rice seeds were also distributed to farmers in Kratie province, which was similarly affected by floods.

Floods also hit over 180 families in Pailin province last weekend after heavy rains from the mountain ranges flowed into the Cambodia-Thailand border area. The disaster damaged houses, personal belongings and some infrastructure, but no casualties were reported, according to Pailin provincial authorities.

Regarding the flood situation, Chan Sinath, secretary of state at the Ministry of Water Resources and Meteorology, led a team of technical officials on Sunday, October 20, to inspect the Phnom Kravanh, Oral and Pich Nil areas. 

Sinath noted that the current inspection is to evaluate and strategise effective water management and usage during the rainy season. At the same time, he said the ministry plans to store as much rainwater as possible through cascade systems in these areas to reduce the water flow into Stung Prek Tnaot.

"The stored water will be released during the dry season to help alleviate drought issues. It will also serve as a vital water source for waterway communication, ecotourism, agriculture and livestock farming, as well as providing clean water for daily use and industrial purposes," he explained.
