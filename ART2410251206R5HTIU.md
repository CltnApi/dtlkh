# Calls to take care of National ID, as viral video shows ‘musical misuse’

The Ministry of Interior has urged the Kingdom’s citizens to take care of their Cambodian National ID cards, after a recent case of misuse was widely reported. Each year, over 180,000 ID cards are lost, damaged or have amendments requested.

The ministry’s General Department of Identification noted some citizens are still unaware of the importance of taking care of their ID cards. Some misuse the cards, or fail to handle them with care. 

Recently, a video circulated on social media showing an individual using his ID card to play guitar, leading to its breakage. Such acts are irresponsible and set a poor example, warned the department.

It explained that the government covers the costs of producing and distributing National ID cards to all citizens, free of charge. 

“Improper use of the Cambodian National ID card leads to unnecessary damage, resulting in wasted state funds,” it warned.

National ID cards are important official documents, as they confirm a citizen’s identity and grant them access to legal rights and benefits. 

Citizens are urged to safeguard their ID cards against loss or damage so they can continue to use them, said the department.

It appealed to all citizens currently using the cards to "Please take good care of them, helping save state funds and honouring the national identity."

Interior ministry spokesman Touch Sokhak noted that many citizens face issues with their ID cards each year. Some lose them due to negligence or damage them by scratching or leaving them exposed to the sun or rain. Others misuse their ID cards as collateral for loans, in spite of legal guidelines warning them not to do so.

He added that, for these reasons, officials receive numerous requests each year from citizens who need to have their cards reissued.

Sokhak questioned whether the government's provision of free ID card services may contribute to the high number of replacement requests, as there are no fees involved.

He also pointed out that in the latest example of carelessness, the ID card used to play the guitar, the card was valid until 2031.

The guitarist’s actions have been widely criticised on social media, with calls for authorities to take action to prevent such behaviour and to promote a “Love Your ID Card” movement.

According to the identification department, to date, nearly 13 million Cambodian citizens have completed the necessary procedures and been issued ID cards. The cards are available from the age of 15.
