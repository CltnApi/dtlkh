# Cambodia introduces streamlined guidelines to facilitate filmmaking

In a recent decision, the Council of Ministers, at the request of the Ministry of Culture and Fine Arts, adopted guidelines designed to enhance support for both local and international filmmakers working in Cambodia. 

The initiative outlines streamlined protocols for securing permits and accessing locations, aiming to promote the country's cultural arts and scenic landscapes on the global stage.

“The revised guidelines retain the current timeframe for reviewing filmmaking permits, allowing up to five working days for TV series, karaoke productions, documentaries, short films and commercials, and up to 15 working days for full-length movies,” according to the decision. 

This timeframe is intended to minimise delays and encourage a consistent flow of production.

Once permits are issued, the ministry will assist in coordinating with other ministries, institutions and local authorities to secure filming venues for producers, ensuring that relevant parties are informed of location requirements.

“After permits and requests are submitted by the ministry, local authorities will not require further script reviews,” the decision read. “To expedite location permits, the maximum waiting period has been set at three working days.”

Under the new framework, producers are required to adhere to set service pricing structures for public filming locations under state jurisdiction. 

Locations without established pricing may not demand filming fees or deposits until an official cost schedule is introduced.

The guidelines also obligate film producers to take responsibility for any damages to filming sites and to maintain public cleanliness and order.

Private companies with economic concession contracts are also encouraged to support the film industry by offering location access and prioritising reasonable service fees to accommodate film production.

The ministry, together with provincial and capital authorities, is committed to implementing these policies effectively to create a streamlined experience for filmmakers.

“This policy demonstrates the government’s commitment, with the endorsement of the prime minister, to resolving longstanding challenges in Cambodia’s film industry,” according to the ministry.

“It reflects Cambodia’s dedication to becoming a major filming destination, showcasing its rich cultural heritage and tourism.”
