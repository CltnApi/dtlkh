Cambodia’s first dedicated Fire Rescue Command Centre was officially inaugurated yesterday. Located within the headquarters compound of the National Police, it aims to improve fire prevention services in the Kingdom.

General Neth Vantha, director of the National Police's Department of Fire Prevention, Extinguishing and Rescue, addressed the October 23 ceremony. He noted that the benefits of the centre include the early detection of fires and a reduction in the risks associated with them.

“This is the first time we have had a dedicated command centre to help manage fires and provide us with advanced warnings,” he told The Post on October 24.

General Sar Thet, National police chief, also addressed the attendees of the opening ceremony.

He explained that the new facility will provide services to selected factories, enterprises, businesses and private residences. The centre is connected to an information network for fire prevention purposes, with Top Fire Safety (Cambodia) Co., Ltd. as a partner, supplying the necessary technical equipment.

“Fires, when neglected or poorly handled, do not only destroy property and homes but can sometimes take lives, cause injuries, or lead to permanent disabilities, affecting people’s livelihoods,” he added.

He warned that business owners should be prepared for fire prevention, and reminded them that the installation of technical equipment and compliance with safety standards is essential. 

Having a fire prevention information system in place allows for prompt action in the event of a fire. The command centre can send alerts directly to a property owner's smartphone, notify the fire brigade and even dispatch the nearest fire truck, for a timely and accurate response.

Vantha explained that private sector establishments can register with the centre to have fire safety equipment installed on their premises. Once registered, customers will be provided with an app that allows them to access the service via smartphone.

“Once registered, with your smartphone always at hand, if there's a problem, you'll be notified immediately. First, the device will send an early warning about a fire to the centre. Second, if the owner is away, the centre will notify them about the fire threat at their property," he said. 

“At that point, you will need to begin initial fire suppression. If the fire grows out of control, the centre will be informed, and the nearest fire brigade will be dispatched for assistance,” he added.

He noted that the centre will be responsible for receiving and analysing any data received from the installed monitoring systems.

He explained that many customers have already registered for the service, with some based in provinces such as Siem Reap and Preah Sihanouk. However, he could not provide detailed information about the registration process or pricing schedule.

According to the National Police, $3.3 million was invested in the centre, in partnership with the private sector. The total included $800,000 for the building, $500,000 for technical equipment and $2 million for developing new technology and establishing the data management system.

Thet also called for continued efforts to improve the quality and effectiveness of staff, particularly fire rescue operators and volunteer firefighters at the grassroots level. He emphasised the need for adequate training and for personnel to be equipped with the necessary tools and resources to enable them to participate effectively in fire prevention, suppression and rescue efforts.

He stressed that fire prevention and rescue units must be fully prepared for any situation and must respond quickly to incidents involving fire.

Additionally, he reiterated that local authorities across the country should contribute to addressing fire risks in underdeveloped area and ensuring that rescue teams can intervene effectively when necessary.

In the first six months of 2024, 738 incidents of fire were recorded nationwide, an increase of 222 compared to the same period in 2023. They resulted in 9 deaths, 25 injuries, and the destruction of 450 homes and 502 stalls and commercial premises. The cause of 41.56% of the fires was electrical faults, while 39.33% were ascribed to the misuse of open flames. The causes of the remaining fires were undetermined.

Vantha expressed his hopes that with the support of the factory, enterprise, and building owners who use the new service, the number of incidents involving fire would be reduced.
