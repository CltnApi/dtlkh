The 2024 SmartStart Unipreneur Learning Platform (ULP) Hackathon showcased the remarkable talent and innovative ideas of student entrepreneurs from across Cambodia. 

This year’s event, held in Siem Reap province from September 25-28, saw fierce competition among teams representing 16 universities. 

Each category reflected the creativity, social consciousness and technical skills of these young innovators, driving the country’s entrepreneurial spirit to new heights.

The winners in five standout categories showcased a range of innovative solutions, addressing key issues such as sustainable tourism, mental health, small-business promotion, youth empowerment and organic agriculture.

Team _Junivers_ from CamTech University won “Overall Excellence”. The team stood out with their creation of an innovation hub that offers authentic local experiences in Cambodia, promoting sustainable tourism and cultural engagement. 

"We are incredibly proud to have won the Overall Excellence award … We hope our project inspires others to innovate by focusing on solving real problems," said Sok Sreylaksmy from _Junivers_. 

She said SmartStart ULP exposed them to the world of young entrepreneurship and helped boost their confidence and skills in order to make their projects run smoothly. 

“Our message for the next innovators – fall in love with the problem, then find the solution,” said Sreylaksmy. 

The _Loung Chet_ team, from the University of South-East Asia in Siem Reap, won “Best Performing Team”. They developed the country’s first anonymous mental health app, designed to connect users through shared experiences and create a supportive community focused on personal well-being. 

The app addresses the critical need for mental health awareness and care in the country.

_Linkifiq_, from the Cambodia Academy of Digital Technology, won the “Best Innovation and Creativity” category. They created an app that helps small local businesses promote their products through low-cost advertising. 

Their solution bridges the gap for artisans, offering them new ways to reach larger markets and improve their livelihoods.

_Youth Connect_, from ACLEDA University of Business, won “Best Social Impact Idea”. They presented a recruitment centre aimed at helping underprivileged youth in Siem Reap gain access to education and vital skills. 

The project highlights the importance of empowering disadvantaged communities and fostering opportunities for the country’s younger generation.

_Khmer Rice_, from Build Bright University - Siem Reap claimed the “Best Prototype” prize. They proposed a new enterprise that processes organic Cambodian rice infused with local herbs, promoting health and well-being for domestic consumers. 

Their focus on organic products and local resources taps into global trends for healthier lifestyles and sustainability.

Each of these innovative projects highlights the entrepreneurial talent emerging from the country’s universities. 

_Junivers_ took home the grand prize, which includes a regional tech trip outside of Cambodia, offering them exposure to entrepreneurial ecosystems, innovative ideas and exciting trends in neighbouring countries. The other four winning teams each received a cash prize of $250 to further refine and develop their prototypes, moving them closer to delivering a viable solution.

"At Smart Axiata, we're passionate about empowering Cambodia's next generation of entrepreneurs,” said Smart Axiata CEO Ziad Shatara. 

“By providing aspiring entrepreneurs with the knowledge, skills and resources they need to succeed, we're investing in Cambodia's future. ULP aligns perfectly with our vision of a digitally empowered and economically thriving nation," he explained.

The competition, organised by Smart Axiata and Impact Hub Phnom Penh, continues to empower the country’s youth by nurturing their entrepreneurial skills. 

Since its launch in 2019, the initiative has impacted over 2,750 students, with programmes aimed at equipping young minds with the tools they need to succeed in the modern economy. 

The event was presided over by So Visothy, secretary of state at the Ministry of Post and Telecommunications, and other local authorities who expressed their support for the country’s growing entrepreneurial ecosystem.

Chhim Tithamatak, program manager and lead trainer of SmartStart ULP at Impact Hub Phnom Penh, said it had been almost five years since the first implementation of the SmartStart ULP entrepreneurship curriculum. 

“It proved to be a game-changer in equipping university students with practical skills and entrepreneurial mindsets to thrive in this new digital age,” said Tithamatak. 

The SmartStart ULP is being implemented across 16 universities: the Cambodia Academy of Digital Technology, the University of Puthisastra, Royal University of Law and Economics, Build Bright University (in Phnom Penh, Siem Reap, Battambang and Banteay Meanchey), the Royal University of Agriculture, Angkor University, Svay Rieng University, CamTech University, ACLEDA Institute of Business, Phnom Penh International University, University of South-East Asia, Paññāsāstra University of Cambodia in Siem Reap and the National University of Battambang.
