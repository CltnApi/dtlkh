Putrajaya will stand firm on its territorial claims in the South China Sea and continue oil exploration activities despite China’s objections, says Malaysian Prime Minister Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim.

He said while Malaysia maintains this stance, it remains open to dialogue and negotiations with other countries.

Anwar added that Malaysia’s approach aligns with Asean’s principle of centrality, advocating for resolution through discussions and dialogue.

“Malaysia will not back down from its claims. That is why the exploration by PETRONAS continues, even though it has been raised by China,” he said during Minister’s Question Time in the Dewan Rakyat on Tuesday (Oct 15).

He also said territorial disputes in the area involved other countries and so China should not be made the sole focus of the issue.

“(These countries include) Thailand, the Philippines, Indonesia, Singapore and Brunei.

“That’s why we don’t agree if this problem is focused on China,” he added in response to a supplementary question by Datuk Seri Takiyuddin Hassan (PN-Kota Baru).

However, Anwar gave an assurance that the country’s firm stance would not hinder diplomatic relations, trade and friendships with the nations concerned.

Takiyuddin had earlier asked the Prime Minister to explain the approaches and strategies for leveraging diplomatic channels through the Asean chair in disputes involving the South China Sea.

Anwar also reiterated Malaysia’s stance on its territorial waters, emphasising that the country will protest and oppose any unauthorised use of its waters as a defence route.

Addressing the Code of Conduct (COC) discussions in the recent Asean meeting attended by representatives from the United States, China, Japan, South Korea and Asean member countries, Anwar stressed the importance of linking dialogue to the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS).

“That UN agreement binds everyone, and I observe that China’s response is in agreement with the UNCLOS framework,” he said.

The South China Sea has been a contentious issue in the region after China laid claim to almost the entire region, despite overlapping maritime claims by Malaysia, the Philippines, Vietnam and Brunei.

In March, it was reported that the second reading of the COC was completed and it is now into the third reading.
