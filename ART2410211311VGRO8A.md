The Tonle Sap Authority has completed the installation of 1,224 boundary markers in provinces around Tonle Sap Lake on schedule as part of the first phase of the government’s demarcation plan, which covers Zone 3.

The posts were installed across six provinces, including Kampong Chhnang with 215 markers, Pursat with 146, Battambang with 171, Banteay Meanchey with 47, Siem Reap with 299 and Kampong Thom with 346 markers, according to the Tonle Sap Authority on Monday, October 21.

“\[The demarcation\] was successfully completed as planned for 2024, reaching 100 per cent of the target. The teams worked day and night, overcoming numerous challenges to achieve this 100 per cent success rate,” the Tonle Sap Authority stated.

The working group is preparing to proceed with phase two of the marker installation, covering Zones 1 and 2, scheduled for 2025.

Sar Kim San, secretary-general of the Tonle Sap Authority, along with a delegation from the Ministry of Economy and Finance, senior leaders and technical teams from the authority inspected the completed work from October 16-20 to assess the progress of demarcating the floodplain areas and submerged forests.

Hel Tony, vice-chairman of the Tonle Sap Authority, was unavailable for comment on October 21 due to ongoing meetings.

The demarcation work follows the recommendations of Prime Minister Hun Manet regarding updating maps and properly marking Zones 1, 2 and 3 of the Tonle Sap area to ensure proper conservation and management of the lake for future generations. The aim is to maintain the sustainability and resilience of the lake and its ecosystem.

Manet reaffirmed his commitment to protecting the Tonle Sap, stating that the government will continue its efforts to restore the lake for the benefit of citizens across the country.

Earlier in January, he also instructed provincial authorities around the lake to prevent illegal encroachment in Zone 3.

The Tonle Sap area is divided into three zones: Zone 1, which is designated for residential and agricultural use with legal land ownership; Zone 2, which is reserved for water-dependent activities like rice farming; and Zone 3, which consists of protected flooded forests where any interference is strictly prohibited.
