The Ministry of Tourism is working with the Indian embassy in Cambodia to host a unique forum which aims to promote tourism and cultural exchanges between the two nations.

The “Cambodia-India Tourism Forum 2024”, which will feature the theme "Potentials of Indian Tourism Market for Cambodia's Tourism: Opportunities and Preparedness/Readiness,” will be held on October 31 in Siem Reap province.

An October 25 press release from the ministry explained that in addition to promoting cultural exchanges, the forum seeks to enhance overall cooperation between Cambodia and India.

It will also promote the flow of tourists and attract more Indian investors to invest capital in the Kingdom’s tourism industry, as well as contributing to the promotion of the "Cambodia-India Tourism Year 2024" and "Visit Siem Reap Year 2024".

“At the same time, the forum will provide an opportunity for tourism experts, the private sectors and related stakeholders from the two countries to build networks, exchange ideas and experiences, and seek joint strategies to contribute to the development of sustainable and responsible tourism,” added the release.

The ministry extended an invitation to all tour operators, tourism associations, the public-private sector, relevant institutions, national and international media, and members of the general public who are interested in participating. The release explained that they should contact Khin Bopha, chief of the ministry’s international cooperation department.
