In a major development for the world of global combat sports, the Kingdom’s own Kun Khmer is preparing to capture the attention of international audiences with its first-ever major competition in Greece.

The event, scheduled for November 24, will be held in Heraklion, on the island of Crete. This marks a historic moment as Cambodia introduces its traditional martial art to Greece, a country renowned for its own ancient culture of combat sports.

The Kun Khmer Federation (KKF) announced that the eight-bout international event is being organised in collaboration with the Cambodian national television network (TVK), with support from well-known local company Vattanak Brewery.

Khov Chhay, KKF president, emphasised the significance of the event during a November 19 press conference. He described it as a “groundbreaking achievement”, while highlighting Cambodia's participation in such a large-scale event abroad.

“This is a milestone for Kun Khmer, not only because it is our first competition in Greece, but also because we are showcasing our ancient martial art to the world. We hope this event will encourage people across the globe to take up Khmer boxing and even inspire the establishment of clubs and federations throughout Europe,” he explained.

He added that in addition to sending seven male and one female fighter, coaching staff and referees – as well as traditional Khmer band – would take part in the event, as requested by their Greek counterparts.

The competition in Greece is particularly meaningful given the country's rich history of ancient combat sports and its status as the birthplace of the Olympic Games. 

Chhay believed that the partnership with Greece will generate greater interest in Khmer boxing across Europe and bring the sport one step closer to its dream of becoming part of the Olympic Games.

“Our eventual goal is for Kun Khmer to become an Olympic sport, with countries around the world competing for medals and trophies. This is the vision we are working towards, and we must all strive to make it a reality,” he added.

Long Sineth, a representative of Vattanak Brewery, also spoke about the importance of the event.

“This is a significant step for Khmer boxing and the Krud Kun Khmer programme as we expand into Europe, particularly to Greece, a country with a culture as ancient as Cambodia’s. We are organising this event to set a standard for Khmer boxing and to increase international recognition,” she noted.

The event will feature a series of high-profile matches, including five championship belt bouts.

Cambodian stars like Lorn Panha will face off against local opponents like Mario Gousho in the 66kg weight class, while Thun Sihong will compete with Tahir Dervishi in the 57kg category.

Other notable fighters who are scheduled to participate include Kim Vassna, Sorn Rakhim, Thun Rithy and Long Sovandoeun.   
The matches are scheduled to begin at 6.00pm local time in Greece – 10.00pm in the Kingdom – and each bout will be broadcast live by TVK.

The athletes have all expressed their readiness for the historic competition, while noting their strong personal desire to showcase the richness of Khmer martial arts to the world.

Sovandoeun, one of the senior fighters, reflected on his past experiences in international matches.

“I have not yet achieved success in previous overseas competitions, but I have prepared especially hard for this event in Greece. 

I not only want to win, I want to bring the ancient culture and heritage of Cambodia to a place as historically significant as Greece,” he explained.SEA Games gold medallist Lorn Panha also shared his thoughts.

“This competition is different from our usual domestic matches. It's not just about the belts – it’s about showcasing and spreading the art of Khmer boxing to the world. I’m determined to return home victorious and make our country proud,” he said.

With strong backing from the Cambodian boxing community and its supporters, it is hoped that the Cretan adventure will slay the Greek Minotaurs and bring Kun Khmer one step closer to global recognition.
