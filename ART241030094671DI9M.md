Candidates prepare to take the Bac II exams on October 8. FN

A senior official from the Ministry of Education, Youth, and Sport has congratulated the students who passed this year’s high school Bac II examinations, while outlining three options for those who were unsuccessful. 

This year’s results show an increase in the number of students receiving an A grade, as well the overall pass rate, year-over-year.

This morning, October 30, the ministry announced that 106,351 of the over 130,000 candidates had passed the examination. The pass rate was equivalent to 79 per cent, up from 72.89 per cent last year, when 98,460 students succeeded.

This year’s results saw 2,216 students awarded a coveted A grade, up from 1,673 in 2023, while 9,701 students earned a B grade, compared to 6,946 last year. Students from Phnom Penh and Kandal Province can check their individual results today, while the scores for other provinces will be available tomorrow.

Khuon Vicheka, a senior education ministry official and spokesperson, congratulated each of the successful candidates and expressed her gratitude to teachers and parents for supporting the students’ efforts. She encouraged those who passed to pursue studies based on their interests, talents and the demands of the current job market.

She also presented three options to those students who were unsuccessful.

She suggested that they repeat their grade 12 classes and re-sit the examination next year, or register as independent candidates, meaning that they will be able to take the test next year, without attending classes.

Another option is to enroll in university to obtain an Associate’s Degree, which could lead to a Bachelor’s Degree through the completion of required credits.

Their third possibility is to pursue one of the technical or vocational education programmes on offer at private and state institutions. She noted that graduates of these programmes are in strong demand in the job market. The spokeswoman explained that vocational education offers specialised training in many fields, catering to students with interests in both social sciences and sciences.

Vicheka attributed this year’s successful outcomes to strong efforts across the education sector, including ministry-led reforms, policy improvements and collaborations with various partners which have enhanced the quality of many schools.

Both standard and new-generation schools also contributed to the growth in education quality and exam results, she noted, adding that she hopes that more model standard schools will open by 2025.
