More than seven tonnes of narcotics have been seized by the authorities in the past year, with over 25,000 suspects arrested. In addition, 94 government officials have been dismissed from public service after failing drug tests. Over 100,000 public servants underwent testing.

In the first year of the seventh-mandate government, authorities investigated 10,008 drug-related cases, arresting 27,817 suspects (2,130 of them women) and seizing 7.518 tonnes of illegal narcotics.

In addition, they confiscated 26,267 cannabis plants, 72 kilogrammes of dried cannabis, and 1 tonne and 92 kilogrammes of chemical substances used for drug production, according to a report by General Meas Vyrith, secretary-general of the National Authority for Combating Drugs (NACD), obtained by _The Post_.

The report was presented to the leadership during an October 21 meeting, held to review the work of the NACD in the past year.

Most of the confiscated drugs originated from the “golden triangle” region and were smuggled across the northeastern and northern borders into Cambodia. They included methamphetamine, ketamine, heroin and other synthetic narcotics. Additionally, concentrated sulfuric acid, a chemical precursor, was discovered in Siem Pang district, Stung Treng province.

“The implementation of the 9th anti-drug campaign has allowed law enforcement to crack down on numerous cases of drug trafficking and use at major entertainment clubs, almost eliminating them. This has led to a significant reduction in drug-related activities within our communities and has prevented the illicit production of drugs within the country,” said Vyrith.

In the course of their investigations, the authorities also seized 67 passenger vehicles, 14 motorcycles and 69 properties, while freezing 118 bank accounts, amounting to approximately $10 million in assets.

Since the issuance of Government Order No. 01 on February 20, a total of 109,670 government officials have undergone rapid urine drug tests. Of them, 98 tested positive for drug use, with 94 already dismissed from their positions. Three more are in the process of being dismissed, while one is under further investigation, according to the report.

Vyrith was unavailable for comment, so it was unclear which specific drugs were tested for, although methamphetamine is thought to be among them. 

The report also noted that through public and private treatment centres, NGOs and community-based public health initiatives, the NACD has dealt with approximately 30,000 drug users and addicts. Of these, 8,512 individuals are receiving treatment in 19 private centres, 5,501 are receiving treatment at 458 public health facilities and 11,982 have been reintegrated into society.

The NACD has also conducted extensive public outreach campaigns to educate the public on drug prevention and control, reaching over 24 million citizens, many of whom have received educational messages more than once.

In a recent example of the Kingdom’s ongoing crackdown on the drug trade, four Chinese nationals were arrested following an investigation by Phnom Penh Municipal Military Police. The operation, which lasted nearly a month, led to the discovery of a large quantity of drugs.

According to the Phnom Penh Military Police, their specialist anti-drug squad coordinated with Phnom Penh Municipal Court deputy prosecutor Plang Sophal to raid four locations, where they found around 100 kilogrammes of various narcotics.

Custody of the four Chinese – three men and one woman – along with the seized evidence has been transferred to the military police’s Anti-Drug Crime Office for legal proceedings.

Plang Sophal, spokesperson for the Phnom Penh Municipal Court, did not provide additional comment on the case.
