# Little theatre of horrors: Halloween takes to the stage this weekend

The Lo-Key Theatre Company is bringing a sneak preview of Halloween to the Speakeasy Theatre on October 26. Supplied

As Halloween approaches, this weekend will see an unlucky 13 Phnom Penhers terrifying themselves in a totally new way … by appearing on stage and surrendering to the power of live theatre!

Three short plays, each one written by a resident of the capital, will be debuted on Saturday, October 26, at the Speakeasy Theatre.

They promise to explore spooktastic themes which will range from murder and shifting identities to serial killers and their victims. 

According to Lo-Key Theatre, the production company behind the Lo-Stakes Halloween Showcase, the three pieces will offer thrills and chills, as well as some much needed laughter.

Each of the performances is expected to run for just 15 minutes, making for a theatre experience that is accessible, and avoids the sometimes misunderstood image of theater as a serious commitment. At a quarter of an hour a piece, there is no need to fear you’ll be subjected to a sub-par performance for hours – another one will be along in a minute to delight you.

The first play on offer, “The Innate”, promises to take the audience on a journey through shifting identities and buried truths, as a woman returns from a long-awaited trip to her homeland. As she reconnects with her loved ones, an unseen force appears to surface within her … Written and directed by long-term Tunisian expat “AJ”, the promoter warns that not everything will be what it seems.

The second act is “Jack the Reaper”. A satirical take on the legend of London’s most famous serial killer, Argentinean theatre stalwart Martin Islas has written and directed an original piece that will see the cast “stumble through a fog of chaos, crime and questionable life choices. Witness the hilarity as they chase a serial killer who’s got a penchant for the city's most ’popular’ ladies”.

According to the organisers, this show promises to be an unforgettable blend of comedy, horror and crime.

“T’Was the Maid”, will be the final performance. It experiments with the classic format of a murder mystery party. Created and directed by Californian Dublin Parker, audiences are going to have to pay attention to the cast and their motivations for a terrible crime.

“As the night unfolds, a shocking murder will leave everyone guessing. Can you solve the mystery and uncover the killer before it's too late?” asks the press release. 

The fact that the Speakeasy Theatre is located inside the Box Office, which features the Kingdom’s largest selection of tap beers and a traditional English pub menu, means even the most cynical punter is likely to have a good time.

The Lo-Stakes Showcase is a long-term project run by Rob Appleby under the Lo-Key Theatre banner. Since August, 2023, it has been dedicated to bringing regular theatre to Phnom Penh. 

Each of the eight previous themed showcases has featured a collection of short pieces – some original, some classic, some obscure – guaranteeing accessible shows for performers and audiences alike. 

Lo-Stakes has seen many first-time actors, writers and directors take to the stage, with the vast majority seemingly bitten by the bug and keen to return. New members are always welcome, with regular pitch and casting parties posted to the Lo-Key Theater Phnom Penh social media channels. 

Tickets for this week’s Halloween showcase are just $10, and available from [TheBoxOfficePhnomPenh.com](https://theboxofficephnompenh.com/), or at the venue itself, on Street 258.
