# Community forest or corporate fortune? How public land became a mine in Cambodia

 ![](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/da0c7d06-d1d5-4ac7-b35c-8e146dcec751)

Mongabay features writer Gerry Flynn joins Mongabay’s podcast to discuss a new investigation he published with freelance journalist Nehru Pry looking at how mining company Lin Vatey acquired thousands of hectares of a public forest, essentially kicking local people, including the Kuy Indigenous community, off public lands that they previously relied on.

In this conversation, Flynn details how a once thriving community managed the Phnom Chum Rok Sat community forest and a robust ecotourism venture, which shut down when most of their land was given to 10 people with close ties to the government.

“Ten individuals seemingly just reached out to the \[Cambodian\] government to ask if they could just have 3,064 hectares of land … much of which is in the community forest. Which is a pretty bizarre request, most normal people can’t just ask the government \[for\] that much land,” Flynn says.
