The Cambodian national football team is set to face Hong Kong in a highly anticipated international away friendly, tonight at 7pm local time.

The match marks the first encounter between the two teams in over a year, with recent performances suggesting that Hong Kong is in better form than before.

Under the leadership of new head coach Koji Gyotoku, Cambodia recently secured a thrilling 3-2 victory against Chinese Taipei, a welcome turnaround after more than a year without a win. This victory came just days after the departure of former coach Felix Dalmas, who left the team on September 13.

Star player Min Ratanak scored a stunning brace, while Sieng Chanthea added another goal, reigniting the hope of fans, who are once again rallying behind the Kouprey. With this momentum, supporters are optimistic that Cambodia can break its long-standing winless streak against Hong Kong, a team they haven’t defeated since 1957.

Koji acknowledges the challenge ahead, noting that Hong Kong appears to be a stronger side than Chinese Taipei, the team Cambodia just beat. Nevertheless, he remains optimistic about his players’ abilities to achieve a historic victory.

While addressing a press conference in Hong Kong ahead of the match, he expressed his excitement.

“We are thrilled to compete here. I had only been in charge for ten days before the match against Chinese Taipei, but we performed well,” he said.

He emphasised the strength of the Hong Kong team, stating, “They are a solid side, stronger than Chinese Taipei. They play well and have many talented players. However, we will strive just as hard to bring victory to our supporters in the Kingdom.”

It’s worth remembering that in all nine previous encounters – friendly and competitive – since 1957, Cambodia has yet to secure a victory against Hong Kong.

The teams have drawn twice and Cambodia has lost seven times. Their most recent meeting ended in a 1-1 draw at Phnom Penh’s National Olympic Stadium on September 7, 2023.

With history on the line, tonight's match promises to be a pivotal moment for Cambodian football as they look to make their mark and continue their return to good form.
