Victims and relevant stakeholders meet at the tourism ministry to seek solutions on November 18. Tourism ministry

The Ministry of Tourism is working to mediate a resolution for over 80 families who lost tens of thousands of dollars due to invalid flight tickets sold by Sakona Travel (Cambodia) Co Ltd for overseas travel packages.

The latest mediation session was held on November 18, led by tourism minister Huot Hak, with participation from lawyers representing Sakona Travel and representatives of 82 affected families.

On November 13, the ministry announced the cancellation of the company’s operating licence due to its failure to fulfil contractual obligations to clients and violations of laws and regulations governing the tourism sector.

Several victims shared their experiences on social media, revealing that they had purchased travel packages for international vacations but discovered their flight tickets were invalid on the scheduled departure dates.

According to a Facebook post by victim Sokhim Chhum, the agency collected a total of $238,712 from 72 families, comprising 344 individuals. Another account, posted by Pich Amily, described similar losses, with victims spending substantial amounts on travel packages and airline tickets without receiving refunds after their trips were cancelled.

The ministry stated that it would follow out-of-court dispute resolution mechanisms using a win-win approach. A tripartite working group has been established, including representatives from the ministry, Sakona and the affected citizens.

The ministry added that it would prepare a draft settlement agreement to be reviewed and amended based on feedback from the parties involved before reaching a final resolution.
