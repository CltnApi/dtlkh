The Korea International Cooperation Agency (KOICA) and the Ministry of Commerce wrapped up a five-day meeting to review findings from the preliminary survey of the “Cambodia’s National Trademark Management Center (NTMC) and IP-Business Information System Development Project” on November 22.

The survey, conducted in partnership with Korean specialists and ministry officials, from November 18, focused on advancing Cambodia’s intellectual property (IP) system. 

This included integrating business data into the country’s trademark and geographical indication (GI) registration and management system while developing enhanced public service functions.

“The Royal Government of Cambodia, particularly the Ministry of Commerce, has placed significant emphasis on modernising digital systems to enhance the delivery of public services. This initiative aims to ensure that services are provided efficiently, cost-effectively and with transparency,” said Ouk Prachea, ministry secretary of state.

The project aimed to advance the Kingdom’s IP system by integrating business data with trademark and geographical indication (GI) registration and management systems and developing public service functions. 

“The project will help strengthen Cambodia’s trademark and brand management capabilities, promote the registration of Cambodian geographical indications, and enhance intellectual property rights protection,” according to KOICA. 

The meeting, chaired by KOICA Cambodia’s country director Choi Moon Jung and Prachea, focused on the survey’s findings and the next steps in project development.

This initiative is part of KOICA’s ongoing efforts to assist Cambodia in building a sustainable and digitally empowered future. 

“As a key partner of Cambodia, KOICA has been dedicated to strengthening the nation’s development through various programs that promote mutual prosperity between the two countries,” explained a release from the Korean agency.

The meeting also included discussions on the establishment of a National Trademark Management Center (NTMC). 

Prachea said the KOICA-supported project is important in boosting Cambodia’s economic resilience and global competitiveness. 

He highlighted that the initiative will contribute to branding Cambodian products both domestically and internationally.

“KOICA remains committed to supporting Cambodia’s development and furthering the long-standing friendship between the two nations,” said KOICA.

“The agency looks forward to working closely with the commerce ministry and other stakeholders to ensure the success of this pivotal project,” it added.
