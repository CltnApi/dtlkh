# Discovery of hitherto-unknown gecko species highlights biodiversity

Hemiphyllodactylus bokor, a previously unknown species of slender gecko, was discovered by Wild Earth Allies conservation manager Neang Thy, in Kampot province’s Bokor National Park. Neang Thy

International conservation NGO Wild Earth Allies (WEA) has announced an astonishing discovery in the Kingdom’s rugged Cardamom Mountains: Three new species of slender gecko.

According to a November 19 WEA press release, one of the species is newly recognised in the Kingdom, while  two were previously unknown to science.

The discoveries were made by the organisation’s conservation manager Neang Thy and herpetologist Dr. Bryan Stuart of the North Carolina Museum of Natural Sciences (NCMNS).

“Their findings, published in peer-reviewed taxonomy journal Zootaxa, underscore the importance of conservation in Cambodia, one of Southeast Asia’s most biodiverse countries,” added the release.

The NGO has been conducting extensive research expeditions to the Cardamoms, while working closely with the Ministry of Environment’s General Department of Protected Areas and specialists from the NCMNS.

According to the release, Neang identified the newly described slender gecko species, _Hemiphyllodactylus bokor sp. nov._ and _Hemiphyllodactylus samkos sp. nov._, through detailed morphological and molecular analyses, in collaboration with Stuart.

The two previously unknown species were discovered in the Preah Monivong Bokor National Park in Kampot province and the Phnom Samkos Wildlife Sanctuary in Pursat Province, respectively. The two critical wildlife areas are situated at opposite ends of the Cardamom Mountains. 

In their most recent publication, the authors also documented _Hemiphyllodactylus typus_ in Preah Monivong Bokor National Park, marking its first recorded presence in Cambodia. 

While both _H. typus_ and the newly identified species, _H. bokor sp. nov._, occur in Preah Monivong Bokor National Park, _H. typus_ appears to inhabit lower elevations, while _H. bokor sp. nov._ is found in higher habitats.

“These discoveries mark a significant step forward in our understanding of Cambodia’s rich biodiversity,” said Neang. 

“The new species highlight the incredible biodiversity hidden within the Cardamom Mountains and a clear need for ongoing research and conservation in Cambodia,” he added.

Neang and Stuart recently collaborated on describing a new species of bent-toed gecko, the Royal cave bent-toed gecko (_Cyrtodactylus regicavernicolus_), also found in southern Cambodia. 

With these findings, Neang has now contributed to the discovery and description of 31 species, illustrating his major personal contribution to the understanding of the Kingdom’s unique and precious wildlife.

“Thy’s field discoveries show that different blocks within the Cardamom Mountains harbour unique species,” said Stuart.

“They emphasise the need to conserve areas throughout the mountain range in order to protect its phenomenal biodiversity,” he added.
