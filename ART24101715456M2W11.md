# PH to Cambodia: Filipinas in surrogacy scheme are victims, not criminals

The Philippine Embassy is appealing to the Cambodian government not to file criminal charges against the 20 Filipinas rescued from alleged surrogacy schemes, Justice Undersecretary Nicholas Ty said on Tuesday.

Surrogacy is considered illegal in Cambodia.

“Currently, our embassy in Cambodia is coordinating with the Cambodian government to express our government’s desire that they not be arrested, not be treated as criminals, and instead be considered as victims of human trafficking.,” Ty said in Filipino in a press conference after the 2nd Regional Meeting of Southeast Asian National Anti-Trafficking Committees at the Diamond Hotel Manila on Tuesday.
