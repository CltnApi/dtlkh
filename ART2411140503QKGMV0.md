A total of 115,200 condoms and 4,000 packets of lubricant will be distributed to the public during the three-day Water Festival, taking place from today until November 16, in Phnom Penh.

The free contraceptives will be accompanied by 45,500 educational pamphlets on HIV/AIDS, 3,000 pre- and post-exposure prophylaxis kits, HIV testing services, counseling, AIDS and STI treatment, as well as a quiz programme offering 800 T-shirts as prizes at the OCIC Chroy Changvar Convention Center.

Sim Suyeng, undersecretary of state at the Ministry of Health, shared details of the plans with local media outlet Fresh News.

This service aims to support HIV prevention, as infection rates in Cambodia continue to show a decline. According to a UNAIDS study released in July, there were 1,200 new cases of HIV in 2023, down from 1,300 in 2022. 

As of 2023, Cambodia has approximately 76,000 individuals living with HIV/AIDS.

During each day of the Water Festival, the health ministry will ensure that more than 600 medical staff are on duty, along with 60 ambulances.

They will be stationed at various locations, including two mobile clinics and 15 health screening tents, to provide round-the-clock health services over the course of the three-day event, the ministry confirmed.
