As part of this year’s Photo Phnom Penh festival, Sra’art Studio will be hosting the exhibition “_FASHION_” by acclaimed photographer Fang Bo Hung.

Opening tomorrow, November 21, the exhibition will run until December 21, offering visitors a month-long opportunity to explore the intersection of cultural identity and artistic innovation through fashion photography.

Fang, a Milan-trained photographer with nearly 15 years of experience, presents a collection that reinterprets cultural symbols through creative techniques in light, composition and colour. According to Sra’art Studio, the exhibition examines “how cultural symbols shape our lives, often unnoticed”, and how in an interconnected world these elements evolve into new forms of expression.

The collaboration marks the continuation of a long-standing partnership between Sra’art and the Phnom Penh Photo Association (PPPA).

“We are very proud to participate in the 15th edition of the Phnom Penh Photo festival. This partnership reflects our shared commitment to promoting artistic expression and providing a platform for both emerging and established photographers to showcase their work,” said Sra’art founder Cecile Eap.

“By participating in the festival, we aim to enrich the city’s cultural landscape and foster meaningful connections within the creative community,” she added.

For its opening weekend, Photo Phnom Penh will hold a three-hour “tuktuk tour”, starting at 2pm on Saturday, November 23 and 9am on Sunday, November 24. The tour will visit eight galleries across the city, including Sra’art. Tickets cost $2 per person for visitors aged five and above and can be booked online at **[https://form.jotform.com/243213103858047](https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fform.jotform.com%2F243213103858047%3Ffbclid%3DIwZXh0bgNhZW0CMTAAAR0Q-V5dxVutjDLFkw-PirVM3vkRV5q11oTpbNLLb5A7UUjOF4feI8KTTes_aem_AsZO-0j78sX30D1vcs4p_g&h=AT2s3Bl0E3JAjms22cAG3-TpLdVAo9pQsE1N8y_N93HAcaNwbTeZw93_RHkabXaOTMyQvrZnX2J5RKtCuO2MHrvP4Z6PAwg-LE0kmhcpLWceisHlwHpQK5GtoT2yVf1sTw&__tn__=-UK-R&c%5b0%5d=AT32cFX5Pt-_FuX0cDavhvI6jZndj_e0xiJ52a5aRRCSrmR5MTHcROFVpaYK4ySELMfJ3W66q4QmEIs7PGEy05k8Yxk8Orf3PHgHYwVFQdEz8NLmZzCVIymSiXtEr20n5umHo16AH44Ga4NDmVUh5yCblTkWw6CzoDu4tIF4lx70WpgPdu5YDog2ys_r9L_6BQ)**.
