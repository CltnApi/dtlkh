In a heartbreaking turn of events, Cambodia's U17 football team was left to mourn a missed opportunity as they hosted the AFC U17 Asian Cup 2025 qualifiers. After a promising start, the team ultimately fell short of their dream of securing a spot in the knockout rounds.

Their tournament began on October 19 with a narrow 1-0 victory over the U17 team from Bangladesh, despite Cambodia playing with just ten men after defender Kea Visal was shown a red card in the 25th minute. They followed up with another 1-0 win against Macau on October 21, temporarily placing them at the top of Group B.

However, their lead was short-lived. Afghanistan’s U17 squad, showcasing their dominance, dismantled the Philippines 8-0 and Macau 9-0, before defeating Cambodia 3-1 in a decisive match on October 25. This result sent the Young Kouprey tumbling from the top of the standings to a disappointing fourth place, with only two wins and one loss.

The final blow came in their last match against the Philippines, where Cambodia suffered a shock 2-0 defeat. The loss eliminated their chances of advancing, leaving fans disheartened and the team reflecting on what could have been.

Afghanistan emerged as the group’s dominant team, winning all four of their matches and advancing to the knockout stage with 12 points. The Philippines and Bangladesh, both with six points, also moved ahead.

Japanese coach Koji Gyotoku expressed his sorrow over the team’s performance.

“This is a result we are all disappointed with, and I feel for the supporters.”

He noted that the players struggled physically against the Philippines, having had only one day to recover from their match against Afghanistan, where they exerted tremendous effort.

Gyotoku acknowledged the need for improvement, particularly in building the players' confidence and resilience. 

“At times, our players show potential, but they lack consistency and confidence,” he said. “We need to address these issues if we want to compete at higher levels.”

Looking ahead, Gyotoku emphasised the importance of preparation for future competitions.

“We must think about next year’s matches and ensure that both our U16 and U20 teams are ready to achieve better results,” he stated. “There are still areas where we can grow and develop our young players.”

As the dust settles on a disappointing campaign, Cambodia's U17 team is left to regroup and strategise for the challenges ahead, hoping to rise from the ashes of their recent heartbreak.
