Nestled in northwestern Cambodia, Siem Reap province has long been renowned for its proximity to the iconic Angkor Wat, one of the world’s largest and most celebrated religious monuments. 

Siem Reap has seen an unprecedented surge in tourism interest over the past year, making it one of the top global travel destinations for 2025. 

Skyscanner, a travel comparison website, recently published its Travel Trends 2025 report which highlighted a remarkable 529 per cent increase in travel searches by Australians for the province in the first six months of the year as compared to the same period last year, placing it at the top of trending destinations worldwide. 

“Our analysis of tens of thousands of data points reveals a clear trend: Australian travellers are increasingly drawn to lesser-known, off-the-beaten-path destinations in Europe and beyond, moving away from more mainstream locations,” said the source. 

Siem Reap’s main attraction, Angkor Wat, originally built as a 12th-century Hindu temple, later became a Buddhist **pagoda** and is now a UNESCO World Heritage Site. 

Known for its majestic architecture and intricate carvings, it draws millions of visitors annually. The 2001 film _**Lara Croft: Tomb Raider**_ boosted its global fame. 

Beyond Angkor Wat, other iconic sites like Angkor Thom, Bayon Temple and the photogenic Ta Prohm provide a deeply immersive look into the ancient Khmer Empire.

The province has diversified with art galleries, night markets and cultural shows like the Phare Circus, which combines Khmer storytelling with acrobatics. 

The Angkor National Museum offers visitors insight into Khmer history through artefacts and displays.

The food scene includes local Khmer dishes and international options, with lively nightlife on Pub Street, featuring bars, restaurants and night markets for souvenirs and handicrafts.

**Convenient travel and accessibility**

With an increase in interest in Siem Reap, flight connectivity has improved, making it easier and more affordable to visit. 

The Siem Reap-Angkor International Airport (SAI) offers direct flights to various cities in Asia, connecting tourists conveniently with the province. 

“Currently, flights to Siem Reap are available from as low as $95 for a round-trip, with direct routes from Phnom Penh, Cambodia’s capital,” according to Skyscanner. 

Additionally, the infrastructure in the province has been developing steadily to accommodate the influx of travellers. 

In its first year of operation, from October 16, 2023 to October 15, 2024, SAI handled 1,300,048 passengers and facilitated 14,556 flights. 

Hotels and resorts cater to all types of visitors, ranging from luxury accommodations to budget-friendly options. 

Boutique hotels, eco-resorts and modern establishments offer a variety of experiences, whether travellers seek a touch of opulence or a quiet retreat closer to nature.

**Other top trending destinations for 2025**

Siem Reap isn’t the only destination seeing an increase in global interest. Nine other locations across the world are also capturing the attention of travellers looking for unique experiences and off-the-beaten-path adventures.

Krabi, Thailand (up 141 per cent), known for stunning beaches, limestone cliffs and clear waters, attracts beachgoers and adventurers with island-hopping, rock climbing and Railay Beach.

Busuanga, Philippines (up 125 per cent), home to Coron Island offers top diving spots with World War II shipwrecks, coral reefs and crystal-clear waters.

Daegu, South Korea (up 123 per cent), combines ancient temples and modern attractions, with cherry blossoms in spring and nearby historic sites like Donghwasa Temple.

Rovaniemi, Finland (up 118 per cent), known as Santa’s home, is perfect for winter travellers seeking northern lights, dog sledding and snowy landscapes.

Cusco, Peru (up 113 per cent), gateway to Machu Picchu, features a UNESCO-listed historic centre blending Incan and Spanish heritage.

Finally, Yogyakarta, Indonesia (up 55 per cent), known for Borobudur Temple, is rich in Javanese culture, crafts and traditional music.

**Search percentage vs. tourist numbers**

However, the huge increase in search volume for Siem Reap does not necessarily mean it has the highest number of tourists overall. Instead, it indicates a significant rise in _interest_ and _searches_ for the province as a travel destination compared to the previous year.

It reflects a surge in people looking up travel information, flights or accommodations related to Siem Reap, which suggests that more people are considering it as a travel option. 

But this metric doesn’t directly indicate the total number of tourists who actually visit.

While the rise in interest is a positive indicator of the province’s growing appeal, other destinations could still attract more tourists in absolute numbers.

For example, global hotspots like Paris, New York or Tokyo may still receive more visitors overall, even if their year-on-year search increases are lower.

France remains the world's most visited country, welcoming approximately 100 million international tourists in 2023, according to recent data by Statista, a German global data platform offering statistics, reports and insights on more than 80,000 topics across 170 industries.

This positions France ahead of other popular destinations such as Spain, the US and Italy.
