# Shape up: Ministry warns overweight police will be assigned to desk jobs

Former interior minister Sar Kheng announced plans to remove overweight police officers from public duties in 2021. FN

Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Interior Sar Sokha instructed all provincial police commissioners to evaluate overweight officers and prohibit them from performing duties in public places.

The directive, issued via voice message, referenced concerns about physical fitness, health and public opinion, which has criticised the appearance of such officers.

"I ask all provincial police commissioners to address the issue of overweight officers with large bellies. This is not to stop them from working but to have them perform office duties. They are strictly prohibited from public duties, especially in places where their presence may impact the public, such as outdoor activities,” Sokha said. 

"Please enforce this thoroughly, inspecting each district, particularly in tourist areas like Siem Reap and Preah Sihanouk. Immediate attention is needed. For officers with large bellies or excessive weight, they must lose weight if they want to return to public duties,” he emphasised. 

Ren Ratanak, spokesperson for the minister, explained that the directive is based on mandatory fitness standards, particularly for law enforcement officers. He said they are required to be in good physical condition – not too thin or too fat – since excessive weight can affect their ability to work, resulting in a loss of agility and leading to quick exhaustion.

In terms of health, Ratanak added that officers and citizens who are significantly overweight often face poor physical condition and are at constant risk of related health issues. He said officers need to be in good health and physically fit to effectively serve the nation and the public. 

He stressed that healthy officers are beneficial both to the state and their families.

Regarding public opinion, the spokesman noted, "Although only a small number of officers \[are obese\], when they perform duties such as managing traffic or apprehending criminals, the public often makes derogatory remarks like, 'How will they catch criminals with such big bellies?'"

For these reasons, the minister instructed the National Police and provincial police to ensure that overweight officers are assigned to office duties. If they wish to return to public-facing roles, they must improve their fitness to maintain good health and avoid further public criticism.

Sok Pisan, deputy police chief of the Siem Reap provincial police, mentioned that provincial police chief Huot Sothy will hold a meeting to disseminate and implement the leadership's directive. However, Pisan noted that he is currently unaware of the exact number of overweight officers.

Former interior minister Sar Kheng had previously warned in 2021 that officers who were excessively fat could face rank demotions.
