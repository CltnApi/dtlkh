Lotus plants, known for their beautiful flowers, also produce tubers that are a popular and nutritious food source in countries like China, South Korea and Japan. The rising demand for lotus tubers and their health benefits inspired one Cambodian – who previously worked in Japan – to establish KT Lotus Tuber Farm, introducing advanced cultivation techniques to the Kingdom.

Long Kunthea worked in the “Land of the Rising Sun” from 2015 to 2023, then returned to the Kingdom armed with the new knowledge and skills he acquired in his time abroad.

“In 2020, I came home to Prey Chamkar village in Prey Veng province to start the farm, but continued travelling to Japan to work until last year,” he told _The Post_.

He has spent the past eight years continuously learning and studying ways to improve his skills. He manages three to four hectares of land, rotating plots to maintain soil health and maximise yields.

“Lotus tubers are short-lived and require daily care,” he explained. “We harvest once every three months and then replant.”

Rotating plots means Kunthea harvests about 1.5 tonnes of lotus tubers daily, but market demand exceeds his supply. 

He aims to expand his farm so he can produce 2 tonnes per day, noting that successful cultivation depends on various factors, including soil quality, water depth, temperature and sunlight.

The tubers are versatile ingredients, and Kunthea also processes lotus roots into powder to meet market demand. Supplied

He imports seeds from Japan and emphasised the need for nutritious soil and proper water management. 

“We prepare the land with natural fertilizers to grow large, high-quality tubers,” he adds.

KT Lotus Tuber Farm sells fresh tubers for 1,400 riel per kilogramme in supermarkets and distributes them across Cambodia, but mostly in Phnom Penh. The tubers are versatile, used in dishes like boiled, fried and stir-fried meals. Additionally, Kunthea processes lotus roots into powder for the market.

Research by the American Institute of Health highlights the health benefits of lotus roots, which are rich in nutrients, vitamins C and B, as well as minerals like potassium and copper. 

They boost the immune system, improve skin health, aid digestion and support heart health by controlling blood pressure and reducing cholesterol levels. Lotus roots also contain antioxidants that reduce inflammation and protect against various diseases.

Looking ahead, Kunthea plans to expand his cultivation area and organise community production to meet market demand. He is also seeking investment partners to expand into the lucrative export market.
