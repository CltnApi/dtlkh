King Norodom Sihamoni has issued a new Royal Decree concerning the title of Oknha, introducing revisions to the previous regulation. Analysts view it as a vital document for regulating individuals who receive this high honorary title.

Dated October 23, the decree stipulates that the title of Oknha is awarded to "Khmer citizens" with significant contributions to national development and infrastructure. The three tiers of the title include Lok Neak Oknha, Neak Oknha and Oknha.

Eligibility criteria for the title include contributions such as financial donations, personal property, resources for social or humanitarian work or significant contributions to infrastructure like roads, bridges, schools and public buildings. It may also recognise innovative technology beneficial to society.

Article 17 of the decree states, “Lok Neak Oknha, Neak Oknha and Oknha must respect the Constitution, laws and legal standards of the Kingdom of Cambodia, uphold high moral standards and refrain from activities that would harm the honour and dignity associated with the title of Oknha.”

The new decree nullifies a previous decree from October 2023 and a sub-decree from June 2024 regarding Oknha titles, replacing rules about annual contributions. In the prior sub-decree, Lok Neak Oknha was required to contribute 400 million riel ($100,000) annually, Neak Oknha 60 million riel ($15,000) and Oknha 32 million riel ($8,000).

The new decree specifies that the title may be revoked in cases of severe criminal offenses. It also mandates that government officials, including civil servants, police and military officers, currently holding the Oknha title must either apply to relinquish it or resign from their posts following this decree.

Contribution levels required to obtain the title will be clarified in a separate sub-decree in the near future. According to the previous sub-decree from June 2024, the required contributions to obtain Lok Neak Oknha, Neak Oknha and Oknha titles were 16 billion riel ($4 million), four billion riel ($1 million) and two billion riel ($500,000), respectively.

This new decree, issued by the King upon Prime Minister Hun Manet’s recommendation, aims to protect the honour associated with the title. It follows cases involving misuse of the title, such as former Oknha Srey Sina involved in shootings, Leng Channa in fraud cases and Khun Panhasith in nightclub incidents.

Pa Chanroeun, president of the Cambodian Institute for Democracy (CID), regards the decree as a significant legal measure to maintain the value and respect of the title.

He emphasized that implementing and monitoring the decree will be essential, including receiving public feedback on individuals holding the title.

Chhort Bunthang, a cultural and tourism expert at the Royal Academy of Cambodia, views the decree as foundational for evaluating individuals eligible for the title based on merit and societal contributions.

He explained that, in the past, the title was mostly awarded to high-ranking government officials who demonstrated significant contributions, high ethical standards and honour. However, in recent times, the title has been increasingly awarded to businesspeople, particularly in the current era.

“On the negative side, there have been cases where some titleholders used the title of Oknha as a means to conduct business or even commit illegal acts. To prevent harm to the reputation of the Oknha title, strict laws must be enforced,” Bunthang said.

“The titleholders may enjoy special privileges, but not to the extent of committing crimes or conducting unlawful business, intimidation or deceiving the public. Ordinary citizens, government officials and Oknha titleholders alike are all subject to the law,” he added.
