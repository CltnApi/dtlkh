# Preah Sihanouk: Cambodia’s gateway to global trade and growth

![](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8c404580-656e-4dbc-9b07-ca1ca5a8cb2e)

The story of Preah Sihanouk’s transformation echoes that of some of the world’s greatest cities. 

Cities like Shanghai and Los Angeles, which today stand as economic powerhouses, were once known for their chaotic growth, unregulated development and infrastructure struggles. 

Similarly, Singapore in the 1960s and Shenzhen, China in the 1980s were resource-scarce port cities, vulnerable to geopolitical shifts and lacking the infrastructure that would later define their prosperity. 

Preah Sihanouk is no different. It has faced its share of challenges in recent years: rapid urbanisation, over-reliance on a narrow set of industries and the strain on infrastructure caused by unprecedented growth. Yet, these issues are not insurmountable.

If history teaches us anything, it is that great cities are forged in adversity, and Preah Sihanouk is on the verge of such a transformation. 

Much like Shanghai in its early 20th-century development or Singapore in the 1960s, our province stands at a crossroads – ready to transform into a multi-purpose economic hub that can drive Cambodia’s future growth.

**A global gateway for trade and investment**

Preah Sihanouk’s location along Cambodia’s southwestern coast positions it as a natural gateway for trade. The Sihanoukville Autonomous Port, Cambodia’s only deep-water seaport, gives the province an unparalleled strategic advantage in connecting to global markets. 

Yet, for too long, this potential has gone untapped. Much like Shanghai in its early days, when its port city struggled to meet the demands of international trade, Preah Sihanouk’s infrastructure and development were insufficient to match the province’s potential.

After years of untapped potential, we now stand on the brink of change. The Master Plan to Develop Preah Sihanouk into a Model Multi-Purpose Special Economic Zone is designed to unlock this potential and position the province as Cambodia’s premier hub for international trade.

Major investments in infrastructure will upgrade the port’s capacity, expand its connections to regional and global shipping routes and create an integrated logistics network that includes a modernised airport, upgraded railway systems and efficient road networks. 

By 2038, this plan aims to elevate the province’s GDP per capita above the national average, positioning it firmly within the high-income category. 

Central to this ambitious plan is the development of four key industrial clusters: tourism, modern agro-processing and food, high-tech manufacturing and advanced producer service industries. 

Just as Shanghai became a global financial and trade centre through sustained investment in infrastructure, Preah Sihanouk is set to become Cambodia’s gateway to the world.

**Tourism 2.0: Building a global destination for sustainable tourism**

Preah Sihanouk is already known for its beaches, islands and abundant natural beauty. However, the province must now embrace a new vision – one that moves beyond casinos and resorts, toward ecotourism and sustainable development. 

A valuable example can be found in Langkawi, Malaysia, which transformed itself from an underdeveloped island into a world-class tourist destination by prioritising environmental preservation.

Through careful planning, Langkawi preserved its rich rainforests and marine ecosystems, creating a unique ecotourism appeal that draws high-end travellers who seek both luxury and sustainable experiences.

The province’s forests, mangroves and biodiversity corridors are crucial environmental assets, covering about 65 per cent of the province’s total land area. 

As part of the master plan, these areas are designated as special policy zones for bottom-line protection, ensuring that they are shielded from large-scale urbanisation and industrial activities. 

Preah Sihanouk’s commitment to forest and biodiversity conservation will ensure that its ecotourism offerings are not only attractive but also sustainable.

By developing tourism belts that connect the mainland to its islands and establishing international cruise terminals, we will create a tourism ecosystem that attracts visitors while preserving the province’s natural beauty. 

The goal is to offer world-class resorts and ecotourism experiences that showcase Preah Sihanouk’s forests, mangroves and coastal ecosystems – much like Langkawi, where rainforests and marine life coexist with luxury tourism. 

Sustainable tourism will be at the heart of this strategy, ensuring that Preah Sihanouk’s natural environment is preserved while providing unique experiences for tourists.

**Diversifying beyond tradition: From single-industry to a multi-faceted economy**

For Preah Sihanouk to realise its full economic potential, diversifying beyond a single industry is essential. Cities like Singapore and Dubai illustrate the transformative power of diversification. 

In its early years, Singapore relied heavily on trade and low-cost manufacturing. Today, it is a global financial centre, tourism hub and high-tech industry leader. Likewise, Dubai, once dependent on oil, has diversified into tourism, aviation and real estate, positioning itself as a global hub between East and West.

Preah Sihanouk has the same opportunity to diversify its economy. While the province has been largely associated with single-industry tourism in recent years, the MPSEZ will enable us to broaden our industrial base, attracting advanced manufacturing, electronics production and agro-processing industries. 

The high-tech industry, in particular, will play a central role in this diversification, with Preah Sihanouk emerging as a hub for electronics assembly and vehicle parts production, as well as smart logistics.

Much like the success stories of the Four Asian Tigers – Taiwan, South Korea, Hong Kong and Singapore – Preah Sihanouk’s diversification will be driven by export-led industrialisation and upskilling the local workforce. 

By investing in human capital through vocational training centres and technical colleges, the province will build the skilled labour force needed to support these industries, creating long-term prosperity for its people.

**Investing in people for long-term success**

One of the key elements of any successful city transformation is its investment in people. Singapore’s journey to becoming a global city was fuelled by its commitment to education and workforce development. 

The Four Asian Tigers followed a similar path, leveraging investments in human capital to drive economic success. Preah Sihanouk will be no different. 

The province’s transformation will create over 540,000 jobs by the year 2038, but more importantly, it will offer opportunities for skilled, high-value employment.

Our investments in vocational training, technical education and partnerships with leading universities will ensure that the people of Preah Sihanouk are not just bystanders in this transformation – they will be its driving force. 

The plan also focuses on improving housing, healthcare and education infrastructure, creating a more livable and equitable society for all residents. By equipping the youth with the skills they need to thrive in high-tech industries and modern service sectors, we will ensure a prosperous future for generations to come.

To ensure efficient and high-quality public service delivery, a comprehensive training programme will be developed and implemented for the MPSEZ Administration, an implementing institution responsible for executing the MPSEZ Master Plan and providing essential on-the-ground business support to investors. 

This training initiative will focus on enhancing the MPSEZ Administration’s capacity in public service provision, simplifying regulatory compliance processes and elevating the standard of investment-related services. 

The goal is to foster a responsive, investor-friendly environment that meets the evolving needs of businesses and aligns with the master plan’s objectives for sustainable regional growth.

**Sustainable growth for the future**

As we embark on this journey of transformation, we are keenly aware that growth must be sustainable. Cities like Singapore have shown how to successfully integrate green spaces, sustainable infrastructure and smart urban development into their growth strategies, all while driving economic success.

Singapore’s focus on green architecture, urban parks and long-term environmental planning has helped it emerge as a model of sustainability in the region.

Preah Sihanouk will follow a similar path, with plans for eco-friendly industrial parks, public green spaces and smart urban development that balances economic growth with environmental preservation. 

Our commitment to green energy, waste management and water conservation will ensure that Preah Sihanouk’s growth is environmentally responsible.

Just as Singapore revitalised its urban landscape while maintaining a focus on sustainability, Preah Sihanouk will become a model for sustainable urban development in Cambodia and the broader region.

**Preah Sihanouk’s moment of transformation**

The transformation of Preah Sihanouk is not without its challenges. The master plan acknowledges the need to address concerns about social security, potential environmental risks and the equitable distribution of economic benefits. 

However, by learning from the successes and challenges of other cities, and by prioritising sustainable and inclusive development, Preah Sihanouk is on the path to becoming a Cambodian success story and a global business hub.

The Master Plan to Develop Preah Sihanouk into a Model Multi-Purpose Special Economic Zone (MPSEZ) provides the roadmap to achieve this vision. 

With its strategic location in Southeast Asia, Preah Sihanouk offers unparalleled access to international markets through its deep-water seaport, expressway connection to Phnom Penh and modernised airport. 

Planned expansions to the Sihanoukville Autonomous Port, rail upgrades and other backbone infrastructure improvements will further boost connectivity, enhancing the province’s appeal as a centre for international trade and investment.

Beyond infrastructure, the MPSEZ will foster a dynamic business ecosystem across diverse sectors, including high-tech manufacturing, modern agro-processing, advanced producer services and a growing digital economy. 

This diversification broadens the spectrum of opportunities for investors and businesses of all sizes, while also creating high-value employment opportunities for Cambodians.

This transformation is about more than infrastructure and investment – it is about laying the foundations for long-term prosperity for the people of Preah Sihanouk and Cambodia. 

Our commitment to education and workforce development will equip future generations with the skills they need to thrive in a globalised economy, ensuring that this progress benefits all residents.
