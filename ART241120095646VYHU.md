Prime Minister Hun Manet has clarified the rationale behind a cabinet reshuffle that has seen Prak Sokhonn reappointed as Minister of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation. The decision, he said, is aimed at enhancing the effectiveness of the government’s operations and transforming challenges into opportunities to advance the Kingdom’s national interests.

Sokhonn was unanimously approved by the National Assembly on November 20 to return to his former position as foreign minister. He will replace Sok Chenda Sophea, who will retain his position as Deputy Prime Minister.

Sokhonn previously served in the role from 2016 to 2023, before becoming vice-president of the Senate in April of this year.

During the National Assembly session, Manet emphasised the need for Cambodia to prepare itself to address external risks, which are rapidly evolving and difficult to predict.

Manet noted several external challenges, including intensifying geopolitical tensions, the potential resurgence of unilateralism and increasing economic fragmentation, both globally and regionally. These issues, he warned, could pose short- and medium-term risks to Cambodia’s economic growth.

Despite these global uncertainties, Manet expressed confidence that the Kingdom could seize opportunities arising from these circumstances, provided the country remains adaptable and responsive to changes in regional and global dynamics. He stressed the importance of transforming challenges into opportunities and leveraging favourable conditions that emerge from evolving situations.

Transforming these challenges, he said, will help enhance the competitiveness of Cambodia’s economy, improve the business and investment environment and attract businesses that may be seeking to relocate from other regions.

Manet emphasised the importance of strengthening the government’s leadership mechanisms to ensure the efficient implementation of its policies, particularly in foreign affairs, international cooperation and commerce. He called for a focus on promoting a foreign policy that is both adaptable and strategic.

The prime minister added that these efforts must be grounded in principles of independence and international law, with a commitment to safeguarding Cambodia’s core national interests, sovereignty, territorial integrity, peace, social stability, justice and dignity.

“With the extensive experience of Prak Sokhonn in foreign affairs and international cooperation, alongside Sok Chenda Sophea’s expertise in commerce and investment, the proposed reshuffle will undoubtedly enhance the government’s capabilities,” he said.

“This adjustment will strengthen Cambodia’s foreign policy and international trade on the global stage, ensuring adaptability and the ability to turn challenges into opportunities to advance national interests,” he added.
