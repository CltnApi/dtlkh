The government has officially recognised four Digital Government Products (DGPs) developed by the Ministry of Post and Telecommunications, while highlighting their diverse functionalities and benefits.

The four DGPs underwent rigorous technical assessments and compliance checks with cyber-security regulations before earning official approval as digital tools and computer programmes for government use.

“A dedicated technical team has been assigned to regularly monitor, evaluate and ensure the security, safety, quality and sustainability of these products, fostering trust and preventing potential cyber-security threats,” explained the telecommunications ministry, in a November 19 statement.

The first of the new DGP’s is an official Government PoT (Point of Truth) repository for public documents from ministries and institutions. Called GO.GOV.KH, it enables the dissemination of verified information to the public, effectively combating fake news, fraudulent documents and phishing links.

The second, FORM.GOV.KH is a secure online form creation platform for data collection, surveys, monitoring and programme registration. This tool serves as a local alternative to popular platforms like Google Forms or Microsoft Forms.

“All data is encrypted with a highly secure secret key, accessible only to the form creator. Even administrators cannot access the data,” the ministry emphasised.

The third is a messaging system called NOMSA.GOV.KH. Thanks to the new system, messages are easily identifiable as coming from legitimate ministries, institutions or private entities, minimising fraud and increasing public confidence.

This tool facilitates the delivery of short messages as notifications or information updates, acting as a substitute for SMS or services like Twilio. 

Finally, an AI-powered text-to-speech tool integrated with Telegram (Telegram Bot), SARIKA converts text into Khmer audio. 

“It is particularly useful for content creation, information dissemination and document narration,” the Ministry added. 

The development of the four DGPs aligns with Cambodia’s Digital Economy and Society Policy Framework 2021–2035 and the Cambodia Digital Government Policy 2022–2035. 

These frameworks prioritise digital technology as a cornerstone for addressing the challenges of the Industry 4.0 era and driving the country’s digital economic and social transformation.

Through these innovations, the telecommunications ministry aims to promote digital adoption in public service delivery, enhance work efficiency, encourage greater public participation in digital systems and build trust in government-provided digital services.
