# Cambodia’s Mu Sochua cries out against China

Prominent exiled opposition politician sees China as a hinderance to Cambodian democracy, freedom and sovereignty.

Without true democracy and a legitimate anti-graft system, Cambodia is destined for heavy debts, low-end jobs, exploited lands and depleted natural resources under its current relationship with China, prominent exiled opposition politician Mu Sochua told Asia Times in an exclusive interview.

Mu Sochua, president of the Khmer Movement For Democracy (KMD), a United States-based activist group, was vice president of the nation’s largest opposition party, the Cambodian National Rescue Party (CNRP), when the Supreme Court banned and dissolved it in October 2017.

She and other CNRP politicians fled the country after the arrest of CNRP leader Kem Sokha on treason charges, including unproven allegations he was working with the United States to stage a “color revolution” the party has consistently maintained are trumped up.
