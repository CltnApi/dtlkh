Former Oknha Srey Sina, aged 50, was arrested by authorities after allegedly shooting and killing two people, an engaged couple, last June at Borey Peng Hout Boeng Snor, located in Phnom Penh’s Chbar Ampov district. Phnom Penh Municipal Police

Phnom Penh Municipal Court will open hearings shortly on two of the three criminal cases involving Srey Sina in connection with a double homicide that captured national attention earlier this year.

On June 17, Sina allegedly went to the home of victim Long Lysong to confront San Sreypich, his tenant, over issues involving tree-cutting, property destruction and clothing hung over Lysong’s premises. 

The confrontation reportedly escalated, leading Sina to draw a firearm, load it and open fire multiple times at Lysong, resulting in his death at the scene. He also allegedly shot Lysong’s fiancée, Khim Kanhchana, three times, who later died at the hospital.

Sina also reportedly fired multiple rounds at two other men, injuring them. He escaped from the scene, but was arrested the same day in Kandal province, bordering Phnom Penh.

According to a November 11 press release from the court, Sina was charged in three criminal cases. These include Criminal Case No. 3991, dated June 19, 2024, which includes charges of murder and unauthorised firearm use, and Criminal Case No. 4059, dated June 22, 2024, involving attempted murder and unauthorised firearm use.

Additionally, Criminal Case No. 4195, dated June 27, 2024, pertains to a home invasion at Borey Peng Hout Boeng Snor in Nirouth Commune of Phnom Penh’s Chbar Ampov district on June 17, 2024.

The charges are governed by Articles 27, 199 and 299 of the Cambodian Penal Code, as well as Article 20 of the Law on Weapons, Explosives and Ammunition Control.

“For Cases No. 1 and No. 2, following thorough legal investigation, the investigating judge has issued orders to transfer these criminal cases to trial, under transfer orders No. 6787 ... and No. 6788 ... dated November 8, 2024. The court will set a trial date soon,” the court stated.

For the third case, the investigating judge is finalising the inquiry to prepare it for trial in accordance with legal procedures.

The announcement also noted that Phnom Penh Municipal Court had received a civil lawsuit from the victim's relatives, who requested a provisional seizure order on both movable and immovable assets belonging to the accused. The court issued a provisional order for asset seizure at the plaintiff's request. 

However, a third party not directly involved in the case has filed an appeal regarding one piece of land, which is now under legal review.

For the murder charge, the accused could face a prison sentence of 10 to 15 years, while attempted murder may also lead to a 10 to 15-year sentence. 

Unauthorised firearm use could result in a prison term of six months to two years and home invasion may carry a sentence of one month to one year.
