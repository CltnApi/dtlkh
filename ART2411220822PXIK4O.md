The Jahoo Ecotourism project, led by the Bunong indigenous community in Mondulkiri province, has earned a nomination for the EXO Foundation’s 2024 Sustainability Awards in the “Planet – Non-Profit/Social Enterprise” category. 

This prestigious recognition honours initiatives that demonstrate innovative strategies in community engagement, environmental stewardship and ethical tourism practices.

Chris Iverson, ecotourism technical advisor for the Wildlife Conservation Society (WCS), emphasised the nomination’s significance.

“Jahoo’s model of community-driven tourism shows that local and indigenous communities can protect their environment while securing more resilient livelihoods dependent on the continued conservation of endangered wildlife and forests,” said Iverson.

The initiative maximises positive impacts within the local community, preserving natural resources while enhancing livelihoods.

This community-owned ecotourism project has empowered the Indigenous Bunong community of Andaung Kraloeng to serve as equal partners in managing Jahoo.

Since 2013, traditional beliefs and customs have been respected, while 24 locals have been trained and hired in hospitality, guiding and research roles.

These positions leverage traditional forest knowledge, creating jobs that are both wildlife-friendly and culturally meaningful.

**Sustainability in action**

Jahoo’s commitment to sustainability is embodied in its Gibbon Fund, launched in 2017. 

“Over $50,000 has been generated through the Gibbon Fund, where $30 from each visitor directly supports community-led conservation actions, indigenous Bunong cultural ceremonies and elderly assistance programmes. This fund ensures that tourism delivers tangible benefits to the community,” said Iverson.

Jahoo protects 700 hectares of vital gibbon habitat within the Keo Seima Wildlife Sanctuary, which is home to endangered species like the southern yellow-cheeked crested gibbon (Nomascus gabriellae) and black-shanked douc langur (Pygathrix nigripes).

The sanctuary also serves as ancestral Bunong land, intertwining cultural preservation with environmental stewardship.

“The project creates space for the Bunong community to protect their historical, cultural and spiritual roots while maintaining their ancestral linkages with nature in a contemporary context,” Iverson shared.

**People's choice award: How you can help**

In addition to its category nomination, Jahoo is competing for the People’s Choice Award, determined by public votes. 

The winning project receives a financial prize and increased recognition for its impactful work. 

According to Iverson, “Recognition and validation from the People’s Choice Award would amplify Jahoo’s visibility and inspire others to replicate its model of sustainable tourism.”

Voting is simple and vital. By visiting the EXO Foundation’s website, you can find more information about the awards and cast your vote. A direct link to the voting page is available on the site.

Jahoo’s success as a model for sustainable ecotourism has inspired further initiatives. The newly formed social enterprise, Sam Veasna Conservation Stays Co Ltd, is collaborating with the community to expand Jahoo’s operations.

A sister site has also been established at the Tmatboey ecolodge in Preah Vihear province’s Kulen Promtep Wildlife Sanctuary.

“This isn’t just about Jahoo – it’s about showing the world what’s possible when communities come together to protect their cultural and natural heritage,” Iverson said. “Collaboration is key to making sustainable tourism a meaningful force for conservation.”
