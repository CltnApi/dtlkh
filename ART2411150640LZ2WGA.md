This year’s Photo Phnom Penh festival brings a story of adventure, courage and unbreakable bonds through the lens of two intrepid Cambodian women, Hoeung Soeum and Sophon Chau.

Their exhibition, Freedom of Two Ladies, hosted at The Peak from November 19 to December 12, chronicles an extraordinary journey across Cambodia’s 25 capital-provinces on motorbikes, covering over 12,000 kilometres in 367 days.

The exhibition invites audiences into a world of pure freedom, a theme powerfully represented in each image.

“How does it feel to own the life you want? To not just dream, but to truly live your dreams?” asked a representative from the event’s organising team. “Hoeung and Sophon’s journey embodies these questions, showing the power of courage and self-discovery in its most inspiring form.”

The two friends embarked on the adventure, leaving behind their routine lives to embrace Cambodia’s natural beauty, culture and rich heritage.

They navigated scenic landscapes and challenging paths, forging lasting memories and building an unbreakable bond of friendship.

“This project is more than just a travel narrative. It’s a vibrant collection of stories, experiences and flavours that reflect the essence of life in Cambodia,” said the organisers.

Their journey was not just about miles covered but about growth, empowerment and capturing the joy of exploring one’s homeland.

Hoeung, who hails from Siem Reap province and studied agricultural economics at the Royal University of Agriculture in Phnom Penh, has spent her career working on education and environmental projects.

She later won a scholarship to study sustainable development goals (SDGs) in New Zealand, furthering her commitment to community development.

Meanwhile, her travel partner, Sophon, has been a strong advocate for youth and women’s empowerment, with over a decade of experience in social accountability, education and livelihood programmes.

Both women’s accomplishments underscore the importance of self-belief.

“Our journey demonstrates that one’s capabilities are not defined by gender or social status. I hope this inspires others to own their lives and create their opportunities,” said Sophon.

Join Photo Phnom Penh 2024 to witness their inspiring journey through Cambodia, where each photograph speaks volumes about resilience, friendship and a love for their country.
