The initiative is rooted in the shared vision of Wing Bank and Mastercard to create a financially inclusive, digital and interconnected future for all Cambodians. 

“Through innovative solutions, we aim to empower our customers and enhance their financial experiences,” said Mr. Han Peng Kwang, Chief Executive Officer of Wing Bank.

The Wing Bank Mastercard One Card was meticulously crafted to provide a seamless, secure and hassle-free payment solution with immediate access to funds whenever, wherever. 

Leveraging the advanced technology and global expertise of Mastercard to enhance the security and convenience of digital payments in Cambodia, the Wing Bank Mastercard One Card features a numberless design, protecting sensitive card information and significantly reducing the risk of fraud and theft.

This cutting-edge technology, which has successfully been adopted in several Southeast Asia markets such as Singapore and the Philippines, improves safety for both online and offline transactions by reducing reliance on the physical card number and instead leveraging tokenised technology. For online transactions, cardholders verify their identities on the issuing bank’s mobile app to approve each purchase. 

Delivering secure and innovative payment solutions, the Wing Bank Mastercard One Card offers consumers seamless access to funds while ensuring top-tier protection. It incorporates multiple layers of security, including real-time transaction monitoring, to safeguard cardholders against unauthorised usage and bolster overall payment security.

“Cambodia is embracing digital transformation alongside its steady economic growth\[1\], with consumers seeking flexible, secure, and convenient ways to transact. The Wing Bank Mastercard One Card provides that flexibility and security, giving cardholders greater control and peace of mind over their finances, said Winnie Wong, Country Manager, Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia, Mastercard.
