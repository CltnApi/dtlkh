China has reaffirmed its unwavering support for the Funan Techo Canal project, while also designating 2025 as the “Cambodia-China Tourism Year”. The two nations have also pledged to improve tourism infrastructure to restore the number of Chinese visitors to pre-Covid-19 levels.

The commitments were made during a November 26 meeting between Minister and Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation Prak Sokhonn and Chinese ambassador to Cambodia Wang Wenbin. The meeting took place two days before Sokhonn’s scheduled official visit to China.

A foreign ministry statement announced that during the meeting, both sides committed to successfully implementing the consensus and commitments made by their respective leaders. This includes advancing key projects such as the Fish and Rice Corridor, the Industrial Development Corridor, the Modern Agricultural Development Project and the Mixed Energy Project.

They also pledged to promote the building of a high-quality, high-level and high-standard Cambodia-China Community with a Shared Future in the new era, serving as a model for mankind.

Sokhonn shared his appreciation for China's significant contributions to Cambodia's development, particularly in trade and investment, tourism, agriculture, energy and infrastructure projects.

“Ambassador Wang reiterated China's unwavering support for Cambodia's development, including the Funan Techo Canal Project and China's commitment to enhancing bilateral trade and investment,” said the ministry’s statement.

Recently, international media outlet Reuters reported that China may withdraw financial support for the canal project. However, this claim, which was supported by anonymous sources, has been rejected by Cambodia.

Sokhonn and Wang expressed enthusiasm for the initiative to designate 2025 as the “Cambodia-China Tourism Year”. They discussed the importance of increasing direct flights and improving tourism infrastructure to restore Chinese visitor numbers to pre-pandemic numbers.

The two sides also several discussed upcoming visits, including a future trip by Hun Sen, president of the Senate and chairman of the Cambodian People’s Party, to China. His visit aims to further strengthen the comprehensive strategic partnership under the framework of the Diamond Hexagon Framework.

Today, November 28, Sokhonn departed for China, where he is scheduled to meet with Chinese foreign minister Wang Yi and Liu Jianchao, Minister of the International Department of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China. He will remain in China until December 1.

Yang Peou, secretary-general of the Royal Academy of Cambodia, noted that the relationship between the two countries remains strong due to mutual reliance, citing Cambodia’s geopolitical significance for China despite its small size.

“Regarding the Funan TechoCanal project, it holds significant value in strategic cooperation in both economic and geopolitical aspects. Therefore, China must prioritise its support for this collaboration,” he said.

Peou added that Sokhonn’s visit to China so soon after resuming his role as foreign minister underscores the importance of bilateral relations. He believes the visit could also include discussions on additional issues, such as strengthening digital security and combating online gambling within the bilateral framework.
