# Second chances thin on ground as CPL clubs face varied fortunes

The turmoil of this year’s dramatic Cambodian Premier League (CPL) continues, with one coach pondering his future after a series of below par showings, and a popular club enjoying a reprieve from the heavy penalties imposed on them after a near-riot.  

Kirivong Sok Sen Chey FC finds itself at a crossroads after a humiliating 7-0 defeat against Visakha FC on October 23. The latest loss means the team has managed just one point from nine matches this season. As the team languishes at the bottom of the league standings, questions are being raised about the future of head coach Venta Sabone.

Following the crushing defeat, Sabone acknowledged that he is fully prepared to part ways with the club if management is dissatisfied with his performance. The Cambodian coach, known for his previous roles with the national team and ISI Dangkor Sen Chey, acknowledged the mounting pressure as the team continues to falter.

“I take full responsibility for the results under my leadership. If the club decides to end my contract, I understand,” he said. His candidness highlights the high stakes in Cambodian football, where success is non-negotiable.

Kirivong’s string of failures has led to intense scrutiny. With eight losses and only one draw, the team is desperate for change. Sabone described every match as feeling like a potential last chance, adding, “I’m not afraid to step down if it means the club can improve. However, if they believe I can turn things around, I will respect their decision.”

The future of Kirivong coach Vinta Saboun is in doubt, with the club producing a single draw and eight losses in their first nine games of the season. CPL

On the other side of the coin, Tiffy Army FC, the National Defence team, is back in the top league after a successful appeal that reduced penalties against coach Phea Sopheaktra and several players for unsporting conduct. 

The penalties were imposed after referee Khin Ouseyha awarded a penalty to Visakha in a September 28 match. The coach was red carded after an altercation with the referee, and more cards were handed to players who abused the referee as the match continued.

Following the latest decision, the team is gearing up to reclaim its position in the league, having suffered setbacks earlier in the season.

Player Josemar Agostinho has had his suspension reduced from two matches to just one, with all financial penalties revoked. Meanwhile, teammate Up Kamol also received a reprieve, seeing his three-match ban cut down to two, along with a reduced fine of 250,000 riel.

This decision follows a successful appeal and discussions with the Cambodian Football Federation (CFF) and its disciplinary committee, allowing the military team to resume their league schedule. In a statement released late Wednesday, the club emphasised its commitment to developing football in the Kingdom and urged fans to continue their support for the sport.

As Tiffy prepare for their upcoming matches, they are focusing on training to ensure they hit the ground running. With these adjustments to player penalties, the team is hopeful for a resurgence in the league. 

This momentum could be crucial as they strive to improve their standings and regain respect in the Cambodian football scene.

As Kirivong struggles, the question remains: Can they turn their fortunes around before it’s too late, or will Sabone be the latest casualty in the fierce competition of Cambodian football? The next few matches will be crucial for both teams as they navigate the pressures of the league and the expectations of their supporters.
