Senate president Hun Sen and Prime Minister Hun Manet have shared their congratulations with US President-elect Donald Trump following the announcement that he has been victorious in his bid to become the 47th US president.

Hun Sen described the win as a testament to the trust and confidence that the American people have placed in Trump’s leadership, vision and extensive experience in both the private and public sectors.

He said Trump’s presidential leadership will further contribute to global peace, stability and prosperity, beyond guiding the US towards a more prosperous future.

“As we will celebrate the 75th Anniversary of Cambodia-US diplomatic relations in July 2025, I firmly believe that through our joint efforts and mutual understanding and respect, our bilateral ties and cooperation will certainly be further strengthened and expanded,” he added.

Similarly, Prime Minister Hun Manet extended his heartfelt congratulations to Trump for his historic return to the presidency.

“Your return comes at a most crucial time not only for the American people but also for the world at large. Under your wise leadership, I am confident that the indispensable US role in promoting stability, security and prosperity will be further strengthened,” he said.

Both Hun Sen and Manet confirmed that the Cambodian leadership is committed to working closely with the Trump administration to elevate the existing excellent bilateral ties to greater heights, both between the two senates and the two administrations.

Manet also pledged to work with the US to advance the ASEAN-US Comprehensive Strategic Partnership during Cambodia's tenure as country coordinator for ASEAN-US dialogue relations.

The Associated Press announced earlier that Trump had received 277 Electoral College votes, while his Democratic rival Kamala Harris received 224. 270 is the majority needed to claim victory.
