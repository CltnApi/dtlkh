Prime Minister Hun Manet expressed his deep emotional connection to Cambodia’s ancient martial arts during yesterday’s closing ceremony of the first "Samdech Borvor Thipadei Cup" Traditional Khmer Mixed Martial Arts (MMA) Championship, held at the Olympic Stadium in Phnom Penh. 

“I was moved to tears seeing the demonstration of all forms of traditional Khmer martial arts,” he said.

“This event is not just about showing these ancient martial arts in action; it is about reminding every Cambodian of the rich diversity and beauty that our ancestors have handed down to us. We must work together to promote and protect these national treasures,” he added.

He explained that the mixed martial arts competition, held over the weekend from October 18 to October 20, was the realisation of a dream he had nurtured for five years. It aimed to bring together various martial arts forms to compete and further develop the knowledge and skills surrounding Khmer martial arts.

“This is a significant step towards preserving our heritage. What we saw here tonight is a perfect reflection of how Khmer martial arts are not separate but interconnected,” he continued, referencing the martial arts performances that combined traditional dance and military combat techniques.

“Every form – whether it’s the ancient martial arts, the apsara dance or the forms of our traditional wrestling – is a part of one unified heritage,” he added.

The competition involved 35 seasoned martial arts instructors from across the country, who not only participated in the event but were also encouraged to collaborate with the recently established "Khmer Martial Arts Secrets Research and Development Committee," initiated by Manet himself. The committee aims to compile and preserve ancient techniques, ensuring their survival for future generations.

In his closing remarks, the prime minister highlighted the importance of research and ongoing development of Khmer martial arts. He called for further collaboration between martial arts experts, the military and educational institutions to ensure these ancient practices are passed down and actively practiced.

“We are living in a globalised world where other countries influence our culture, including our martial arts. But as Cambodians, we have a rich and unique cultural heritage,” he emphasised.

 “We must lead the effort to preserve and promote our identity. The key is to start with ourselves, in our own country, and spread this cultural pride to all corners of Cambodia – from the military to schools, clubs and communities,” he added.

While acknowledging the importance of international martial arts, including Karate and Taekwondo, Hun Manet made it clear that preserving and promoting traditional Khmer martial arts should remain a priority. He urged all citizens to get involved in the effort to safeguard this precious part of Cambodia’s identity.

“The preservation and development of Khmer martial arts is a collective responsibility. All of us here today are part of this mission, and together we can ensure that our martial arts live on,” he said.

The competition featured 482 participants, including 348 men and 77 women, who competed across four weight each, as well as in two professional weight divisions and four demonstration categories.

Thong Khon, president of the National Olympic Committee of Cambodia (NOCC), who also chaired the organising committee for the event, announced that the competition had adhered to principles of fair-play, emphasising the spirit of unity and camaraderie among the participants.

“All competitors have shown respect for the new technical standards of traditional Cambodian mixed martial arts and have followed the fair-play rules, demonstrating harmony and mutual respect within the Cambodian martial arts community,” he noted.

The event was a resounding success, with competitors from various organizations, including the Cambodian Mixed Martial Arts Federation, the Cambodian Boxing Federation, the Khmer Wrestling Federation and others, all vying for medals and recognition.
