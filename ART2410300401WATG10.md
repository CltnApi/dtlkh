In a highly anticipated matchup, Cambodia's top league team, Preah Khan Reach Svay Rieng, have travelled to Mongolia, where they will take on their Mongolian league champion counterparts  Selenge Press Falcons at home.

 The match, part of the AFC Challenge League 2024/2025 East Asia qualifiers, will kick off at MFF Stadium in Ulaanbaatar this afternoon, at 2pm Cambodia time.

Currently positioned at the top of Group E, the SP Falcons are coming off a hard-fought 0-0 draw against Indonesia’s Madura United. Svay Rieng head coach Jose Munoz recognised the quality of both teams, predicting a tough challenge for his side as they aim for advancement.

“This AFC Challenge League is another opportunity for us on the international stage,” he said, as he addressed a press conference in Mongolia. 

“We need to focus intensely and perform our best, especially against SP Falcons, who will be playing on their home turf,” he added.

Munoz emphasised the importance of a strong start in this crucial match: “This is a challenging game for us, playing away against a solid team. But we are excited to compete.”

He warned that the impressive skills of the Falcons, particularly in ball control and teamwork, will make them a formidable opponent. 

“They play aggressively and are adept at finding space for effective attacks," he said, adding “Playing at home will undoubtedly boost their morale.”

Svay Rieng’s Japanese star Ryo Fujii echoed Munoz's sentiments, stressing the need for the team to harness all their energy.

“To control the match, we must perform better than our opponents,” he explained.

Munoz also acknowledged the quality of Madura United, identifying them as a high-level team with both foreign and local talent, noting that they will also pose a challenge.

“We know both matches will be difficult, but we aim to maintain our performance level away from home and showcase our capabilities as a top Cambodian league team,” he said.

The Spanish coach expressed concerns about acclimatising to the cold Mongolian weather and the artificial turf, which presents its own set of challenges. 

“We need to adapt quickly to the conditions here and give our best effort both individually and as a team. Our main goal is to advance to the next round, and that’s why we’re here,” he concluded.

As the clock ticks down to this afternoon’s kickoff, both teams are poised for a showdown that could shape their paths in this international competition.
