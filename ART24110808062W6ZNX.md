Approximately 100 million mixed fish species have been saved from illegal fishing practices and released back into natural habitats during the five-month closed season, contributing to an increase in populations, according to a press release from the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries on November 7.

The ministry noted that during the closed fishing season, from June 1 to October 31, the ministry’s Fisheries Administration (FiA) and national intervention forces, with cooperation from provincial and district joint forces and related authorities, cracked down on offences nationwide.

"The crackdown and prevention of fisheries offences resulted in a total of 1,506 cases. Of these, 1,410 involved the seizure and destruction of evidence, 56 were sent to court, 15 offenders were imprisoned and 40 incurred administrative fines amounting to 161,691,000 riel \[$39,925\]," it read. 

Key confiscated items included over 790,000 metres of seine nets, 459 electrofishing devices – 165 of which were voluntarily surrendered – and 106 units of water drag and hoop nets.

Additionally, authorities dismantled three sites used for the production and distribution of electrofishing equipment and released approximately 100 million mixed fish species, equalling over 40 tonnes, back into natural waters.

"As a result of these efforts, fish populations in natural habitats have started to increase notably. Concurrently, the population of the Mekong River dolphin has also risen, from 90 in 2022 to 104 by October 2024," the statement read. 

The ministry attributed the improvement in fish resources to the participation of local fishermen and stakeholders who cooperated by providing information and helping to prevent and suppress illegal fishing activities. 

They also contributed to the release of endangered and brood fish species back into natural waters to sustain aquatic resources.

While ministry officials continue their crackdown on fisheries offences, ministry spokesperson Khim Finan told The Post that the ongoing efforts, especially over the past two years, have shown positive results.

"We have intensified these crackdowns, which have led to an increase in fish yields in Tonle Sap Lake. Most results come from stopping the use of electrofishing and other illegal fishing tools, as well as preventing fishing during the closed season,” he said.

 “This work has been ongoing for two years now, not just recently. Overall, we have achieved good results thanks to stricter measures against illegal fishing," he added. 

The ministry urged the public to continue participating in the conservation and protection of valuable natural aquatic resources. Additionally, it called on people to promptly report any illegal fishing activities to fisheries officials.

The ministry stated that the protection, preservation and conservation of aquatic resources ensure the sustainability of natural fish stocks and food security for the Cambodian people. 

It also enhances the country’s prestige on the international stage in terms of preserving rare fish resources that are nearly extinct or already lost in some countries around the world.

On November 1, the FiA also called on traders and fishermen to release or report endangered or rare species found during fishing.

Following this appeal, Sin Chansat, a fisherman from Kampong Luong commune in Pursat province’s Krakor district, released an endangered 26-kilogramme Mekong giant catfish into the Kampong Prak Fisheries Conservation Area on November 3, according to the Pursat provincial agriculture department.
