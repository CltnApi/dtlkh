The Ministry of Industry, Science, Technology and Innovation and UNIDO, through its CAPFISH-Capture project, hosted a workshop on November 19, aimed at strengthening university-industry linkages (UIL) to drive Cambodia’s innovation and economic growth.

The event gathered policymakers, industry leaders, development partners and academic representatives to explore how collaboration can enhance the country’s science, technology and innovation (STI) ecosystem, according to a joint press release.

According to the release, the workshop focused on the Triple Helix Model, emphasising partnerships between academia, industry and government. Participants discussed strategies for research collaboration, technology transfer and innovation management, contributing to the development of a national UIL guideline aligned with the country’s STI Roadmap 2030.

Industry minister Hem Vanndy highlighted the importance of aligning academic research with industry needs to foster innovation.

“Aligning university research with industry needs fosters innovation and enhances educational quality. It creates valuable opportunities for students in Cambodia to acquire the skills needed for today’s job market and enables universities to produce research outcomes that address real-world challenges and directly benefit industries,” he was quoted as saying in the release.

The minister also urged innovators to protect their intellectual property by registering patents, underlining its role in securing research contributions and inspiring further advancements.

The statement highlighted that UNIDO’s CAPFISH-Capture project, co-funded by the EU, introduced the Food Technology, Research and Innovation Platform (FTRIP) to connect academic institutions, the food sector and government agencies. It added that the initiative has already supported micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) by improving fish processing techniques and fostering innovative solutions in the food industry.

Bryan Fornari, head of cooperation at the EU Delegation to Cambodia, emphasised the importance of UIL in driving economic progress.

“The EU recognises UIL as essential for Cambodia’s innovation and competitiveness. By fostering connections between academia and industry, we ensure that knowledge translates into market-driven solutions, creating economic opportunities, jobs and enhanced competitiveness,” he stated.

UNIDO Cambodia representative Sok Narin echoed these sentiments, noting that initiatives like FTRIP enhance the productivity and competitiveness of the country’s MSMEs, contributing to economic resilience.

The country’s STI Roadmap 2030 places UIL at the heart of its strategy to advance science and technology. By strengthening these partnerships, the government aims to accelerate innovation, develop human resources to meet industrial demands and stimulate sustainable economic growth.
