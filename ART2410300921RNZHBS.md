A business delegation from Gyeongbuk Technopark, a leading South Korean innovation hub, has expressed interest in collaborating with the Cambodian government to develop a technology park in Cambodia. 

In a meeting held on October 28 with Minister of Industry, Science, Technology and Innovation Hem Vanndy, the delegation discussed potential areas for cooperation, highlighting opportunities in high-tech industries and green technology, according to an October 29 ministry press release. 

Minjae Joung, head of centres at Gyeongbuk, noted that the organisation is keen to explore the country’s priority sectors for Korean investment, particularly in technology research and development. He emphasised the group’s expertise in innovation and its interest in supporting Cambodia's economic transition.

During the meeting, Vanndy underscored the country’s focus on economic diversification and the shift towards a knowledge-based and technology-driven economy. 

He encouraged Gyeongbuk to consider offshoring high-tech manufacturing operations to Cambodia, pointing out the country’s favourable investment climate. 

“As Cambodia is gradually transitioning from a mere technology user to a technology developer, we welcome partnerships that can help establish technology hubs and support small and medium-sized enterprises \[SMEs\] in sectors like agro-industry and export-oriented production,” Vanndy was quoted as saying in the release.

Joung confirmed that the organisation’s interests align with the country’s priorities, particularly in areas such as smart farming and green technology. He also proposed the establishment of a centre for testing medical equipment to promote health technology, a proposal welcomed by the minister.

Vanndy assured the delegation that the ministry would fully support investment ventures in Cambodia and encouraged them to seek credible local partners. 

“It’s important to get real, first-hand information from official channels, and we recognise Korea as a key partner in Cambodia's STI development,” he added, noting Cambodia’s access to ASEAN, the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) and various free trade agreements (FTAs), which provide significant regional and global market opportunities.

According to the release, this potential collaboration between Cambodia and Gyeongbuk Technopark could pave the way for enhanced technological innovation, further solidifying the country’s role in the region’s growing technology-driven economy.
