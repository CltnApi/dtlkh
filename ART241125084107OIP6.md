The Siem Reap-Angkor Summit on a Mine-Free World kicks off today in Siem Reap province and will conclude on November 29, with the aim of reviewing the operation and status of the Ottawa Convention and reflecting the shared determination of 164 member states to rid the world of the cruel and lingering legacy of landmines.

Also referred to as the Fifth Review Conference (5RC) of the Convention on the Prohibition of the Use, Stockpiling, Production and Transfer of Anti-Personnel Mines and on Their Destruction, the summit marks the first time Cambodia has hosted such an event.

The gathering has drawn approximately 700 delegates from 150 member countries and partners of the convention.

Speaking at the opening ceremony, Prime Minister Hun Manet reflected on Cambodia’s history as a battlefield during the Cold War, which left the country littered with millions of landmines and explosive remnants of war (ERW).

He noted that Cambodia has so far destroyed over one million anti-personnel landmines and more than three million ERWs, clearing over 3,000 square kilometres of land. Phnom Penh and 14 other provinces have already been declared landmine-free.

The prime minister highlighted a significant reduction in landmine victims, with annual numbers dropping to under 100 in the last decade, compared to over 4,000 in 1996. However, he noted that the country still has more than 1,600 square kilometres to be cleared, affecting approximately one million people.

On Cambodia’s global contributions to mine action, Manet noted that Cambodia has shared expertise and best practices in mine action with ASEAN members, as well as countries such as Ukraine, Afghanistan, Armenia and Azerbaijan. He urged all state parties to reaffirm their commitments under the Ottawa Convention, calling it a vital document for humanity.

“Cambodia calls on all countries to join us in this mission to make the world safer and more peaceful, not just for the current generation, but for generations to come. We must double our efforts in searching for and clearing landmines, expanding education and awareness and increasing support for victims worldwide,” he stated.

Greeting participants at the summit, Ly Thuch, president of the Anti-Personnel Mine Ban Convention and the Cambodian Mine Action and Victim Assistance Authority (CMAA), emphasised the shared global determination to eliminate landmines.

“This summit is not just a meeting of nations but a collective reaffirmation of our unwavering commitment to peace, human dignity and solidarity. Together, we stand at the crossroads of history, where the painful memories of conflict are being replaced by a future built on hope, resilience and peace,” he said.

Armida Salsiah Alisjahbana, undersecretary-general of the UN and executive secretary of the UN Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (UN-ESCAP), highlighted the significant achievements of the past 25 years, during which over 55 million anti-personnel devices have been destroyed across more than 60 countries.

Delivering a message from UN secretary-general António Guterres, Alisjahbana praised Cambodia for hosting the conference and making substantial progress in mine clearance.

“I call on state parties to meet their obligations and ensure compliance with the convention while addressing humanitarian and developmental impacts through financial and technical support. I also encourage all states that have not yet acceded to the convention to join the 164 that have done so. A world without anti-personnel mines is not yet a reality, but it is within reach.

“This conference and its Siem Reap Action Plan represent a critical step toward achieving this vision and ensuring that all people can live their lives in safety, dignity and hope,” Guterres stated, as read out by Alisjahbana.
