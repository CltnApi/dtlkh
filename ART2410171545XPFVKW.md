# US apparel sector concerned by probe into Cambodia worker rights group

Major brands and conglomerates, including Adidas, VF Corporation and PVH Corporation sourcing from the apparel sector of Cambodia have come together to cite concerns over the timings of the Cambodian government's investigation of the NGO CENTRAL.

The statement issued by the coalition of brands expressed “serious” concerns over the timing of the Ministry of Interior’s investigation into the Center For Alliance Of Labor And Human Rights (CENTRAL) following their report, ‘Barriers to Representation: Freedom of Association in Cambodia – an assessment of Better Factories Cambodia’s FOA compliance monitoring.’

The letter states: “It appears that the government’s investigation and document requests of CENTRAL is in reaction to their June report. As global brands sourcing from Cambodia, we respectfully urge the Cambodian government in the strongest possible terms to immediately cancel the audit of CENTRAL and refrain from taking any measures that could be perceived as restricting civil society space or freedom of speech.”
