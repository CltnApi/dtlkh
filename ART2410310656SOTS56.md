Under the bright lights of Phnom Penh’s National Olympic Stadium, the excitement was palpable last night, as Prime Minister Hun Manet opened the 4th National Games and 2nd National Para Games. 

The grand event, which saw over 30,000 spectators braving the rain to cheer on their favourite athletes, highlighted not only the spirit of competition but also the unity and pride of the nation on the international stage.

As he addressed the opening ceremony, Manet emphasised the significance of sports in showcasing Cambodia’s collective spirit.

“Today, even the heavens celebrate with us,” he declared, expressing gratitude for the collaborative efforts that made the event possible. 

“This occasion reflects our solidarity and the indomitable spirit of our athletes,” he added.

The vibrant opening ceremony was a feast for the senses, featuring a rich tapestry of sports, traditional arts and cultural performances. From rhythmic gymnastics to spirited musical acts, the event captivated the audience, igniting a sense of national pride that echoed throughout the stadium.

Manet praised the Ministry of Education, Youth, and Sports, along with the National Olympic Committee of Cambodia (NOCC) and various sports federations, for their unwavering support in advancing sports in the Kingdom.

“The National Games illustrate our commitment to sporting excellence on both national and international platforms,” he noted.

A total of 2,522 athletes competed in 36 sports, including 13 for para-athletes, with events set to take place in various provinces including Phnom Penh, Kep, and Sihanoukville. 

The games will serve as a showcase of the Kingdom’s growth in the sports arena, especially as the nation gears up to host the 5th Asian Youth Games in 2029.

Manet highlighted the broader impact of sports on Cambodian society, noting its role in promoting political unity, economic growth and cultural pride. 

“Sports forge friendships and cooperation, both regionally and internationally,” he explained.

The prime minister also reflected on Cambodia's remarkable success at the recent Southeast Asian Games and ASEAN Para Games, where the nation secured a total of 282 medals, including 81 golds. This achievement placed Cambodia 4th among participating nations, drawing the admiration of many regional counterparts.

As the National Sports Games 2024 unfolds, the nation watches eagerly as its athletes strive for glory and inspire future generations.
