# Hydropower dams further undermine REDD+ efforts in Cambodia

Five hydropower dams are currently being built in the Cardamom Mountains with reservoirs set to collectively span more than 15,000 hectares (37,065 acres) across protected forests.

“Fifteen years ago, this whole village was forest,” said Phan, sipping an energy drink and leaning back in his plastic chair. “At first, I didn’t want to stay here because the road conditions were so bad, and even though we had some money, it was difficult to find food and to survive.”

But those times, and much of the forest in Pursat province’s O’Soam commune, are long gone as hydropower dams have prized open the remote Cardamom Mountains since 2012, literally paving the way for communities like Phan’s.

Plumes of dust rose from the red dirt road as Phan sat watching the construction crew working a few hundred meters farther down the road, waiting for them to rehabilitate the section in front of his small wooden home.
