A giant in more than just stature, Soun Channaro (number 17) led the Cambodian team onto the field during the SEA Games twice, securing bronze and silver medals for the Kingdom. Supplied

Soun Channaro, who captains Cambodia's national volleyball team, has officially announced his retirement from professional volleyball. The decision marks the end of a remarkable chapter in his career. 

Renowned for his contributions to the national squad – helping secure multiple medals at international competitions – the volleyball federation is determined not to let him fade from the sport entirely.

During his Monday retirement ceremony, held at Chip Mong Megamall, Aing Serey Piseth, secretary-general of the Cambodian Volleyball Federation, expressed his sadness over Channaro's departure. However, he emphasised that Minister of Interior Sar Sokha, who heads the federation, and other leaders are eager to keep Channaro involved in the sport.

“Under the guidance of Sokha, we hope Soun Channaro will not drift away from volleyball,” he said.

“He possesses invaluable skills and could transition into coaching roles, either as a national team coach or within club training,” he added.

There’s even speculation that Channaro might return to the national team if he can manage his weight and recover from injuries, as he is considered a key player in Cambodian volleyball. 

“Channaro is a hero in Cambodian volleyball, having shaped our presence on the international stage. His retirement will undoubtedly impact our team, since no current player can match his level,” noted Serey Piseth.

“His retirement is partly due to health issues and also opens the door for young talents to step up, but if the federation can support his recovery, there’s a chance he could return to the court,” he added.

Leang Meng, co-founder of Cambodian beverage company Cambo Brewery, which has heavily invested in volleyball, also voiced his disappointment regarding Channaro’s retirement.

“He has sacrificed so much to elevate the status of Cambodian volleyball. I do not wish to see such a talented player leave our sport,” he said.

Meng praised Channaro's dedication, adding, “His sacrifices for our country’s pride and reputation are commendable. I believe future generations will continue to build on the foundation he has laid.”

Soun Channaro began his volleyball journey at a young age, joining the Cambodian Army's volleyball team in 2012 before moving to the Pracheachak Volleyball Club in 2017, later rebranded as the Visakha Volleyball Club. 

In the past six years, he has led Visakha to numerous domestic and international victories, as well as playing an instrumental role in Cambodia’s first-ever medal at the SEA Games in 2022 – a bronze – and a silver medal in 2023.

Reflecting on his achievements, Channaro remarked, “My heart belongs to the Cambodian flag. Every time I compete, I focus on our national pride. My goal was always to finish among the top three, and I was thrilled with our results at the SEA Games.”

Despite the silver and bronze medals, Channaro feels Cambodia has more to achieve.

“I urge our young athletes to enhance their skills and aim for gold in the 2025 SEA Games in Thailand. If my health permits, I would love to help the team again. My love for my country is unwavering,” he added.

At 1.90 metres tall and as one of the greatest setters the Kingdom has ever known, Channaro has played an outsize role in Cambodian volleyball. While he may be stepping back from competition, his legacy – and possibly his future contributions – remain intertwined with the sport he has dedicated his life to.
