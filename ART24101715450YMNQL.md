# Can Hun Manet chart Cambodia a new course free from his father’s shadow?

The new PM’s first year in charge has been defined by attempts to bolster Cambodia’s international standing and prioritise strong China ties.

In his first year as Cambodia’s new prime minister, Hun Manet has walked a fine line between honouring his father’s legacy and charting a new, more technocratic course for the nation. He has continued to prioritise strong ties with China since taking office, while also emphasising stability, continuity and “maintaining the status quo”, analysts say.

Sworn in as the successor to his father, Hun Sen, who reigned for nearly four decades, Hun Manet acknowledged the weight of his predecessor’s influence during his acceptance speech to the National Assembly, Cambodia’s lower house of parliament, last August. He expressed his gratitude for the trust placed in him, stating that the lessons learned from his father and former ministers would serve as “permanent fixtures within our consciences and consciousness”.
