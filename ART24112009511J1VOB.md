Cambodia is set to host the 5th Kun Khmer Championship in Siem Reap, as part of ongoing efforts to showcase its traditional martial art on the global stage and push for its inclusion in future Olympic Games. 

The international event, scheduled for December 6-8, is poised to be the biggest Kun Khmer competition yet, drawing 118 athletes from 24 countries.

The tournament, organised by the Kun Khmer International Federation (KIF) – in collaboration with the Cambodian National Olympic Committee (NOCC), the Kun Khmer Boxing Federation, and several partners – aims to elevate the sport’s profile worldwide. 

Kun Khmer, a combat sport deeply rooted in Cambodian culture, already earned major recognition at the 2023 SEA Games, hosted by Cambodia. The ultimate goal is to secure its place in the Olympic Games, with officials looking toward the 2032 Olympics in Australia as a potential milestone.

Meam Ra, president of the KIF, spoke at a recent press conference about the growing popularity of the event.

“This year marks the fifth edition of our competition, and we are organising the largest one yet,” he said.

“The number of participants has increased significantly compared to previous years, and we are excited to feature both professional-level matches and more developmental competitions, including for younger athletes,” he added.

This year's championship will include professional and semi-professional bouts, as well as youth categories for athletes aged 10 to 17. 

The youth competitions are designed to help young athletes sharpen their skills in preparation for future regional events, including the 2029 Asian Youth Games, which will be held in Cambodia. 

Ra emphasised that the development of Kun Khmer at the youth level is vital for the sport’s long-term success and its Olympic aspirations.

The road to the Olympics is still challenging. While Cambodia succeeded in introducing Kun Khmer at the 2023 SEA Games, Ra pointed out that in order for the sport to be included in the Olympics, the International Kun Khmer Federation needs to secure support from at least 100 member nations.

 Currently, there are 60 members, and Cambodia is actively working to expand its global network of supporters. 

“We need to organise more regional championships in different continents and countries, such as in Europe, Africa, Australia and North America, to grow the sport’s influence,” Ra said.

“Next year, we plan to hold continental championships in countries like France, Australia and Canada, with the goal of holding regional events around the world,” he added.

Tem Moeun, honorary president of the Kun Khmer Boxing Federation and NOCC vice-secretary general, praised the efforts of the international federation and its partners.

“This event has grown over the past four years, and we are committed to making it even bigger and more impactful,” he said.

“Through events like this, we hope to spread the message of Kun Khmer worldwide and ensure that Cambodia’s martial arts heritage is recognised on the global stage,” he continued.

With the 5th Kun Khmer Championship just around the corner, the Kingdom’s ambition of one day seeing Kun Khmer included at the Olympics appears to be growing closer. Perhaps one day soon Cambodia’s rich cultural heritage will be showcased through its traditional martial art in front of a wider international audience.
