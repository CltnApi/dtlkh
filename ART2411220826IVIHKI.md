Kim Beazley, chairman of the Australian War Memorial and former Australian Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Defence, will visit Siem Reap province from November 23-26 to attend the Fifth Review Conference (5RC) of the States Parties to the Anti-Personnel Mine Ban Convention, also known as the Ottawa Convention.

The visit underscores Australia’s enduring partnership with Cambodia in the fight against landmines, according to a November 22 press release from the Australian embassy in Cambodia.

The release noted that the convention, which gathers global leaders and experts in demining, highlights Cambodia’s leadership in mine action. 

Once one of the world’s most heavily mined countries, Cambodia has emerged as a global advocate for a world free of mines.

It added that through the tireless efforts of the Cambodian Mine Action and Victim Assistance Authority (CMAA) and related agencies, the country has made remarkable progress in clearing land contaminated by explosive remnants of war (ERW).

“Cambodia’s journey toward becoming a mine impact-free country is an inspiring example,” stated the Australian delegation. “Together, we are working toward a shared vision of safety, prosperity and dignity for all.”

According to the release, Australia has been a steadfast partner in Cambodia’s demining efforts for over 30 years, contributing approximately AUD 100 million (about $65 million) to support mine action.

Australian assistance has provided advanced equipment, training for local deminers and funding for programmes that prioritise the rehabilitation and reintegration of landmine survivors.

“Millions of people worldwide live in the shadow of fear because of landmines, hidden dangers that permeate fields, roads and even where children play. These silent threats … stand as a major obstacle to development and opportunity,” UNDP administrator Achim Steiner said in a CMAA video post.

“Since the advent of the Anti-Personnel Mine Ban Convention 25 years ago, the global use of landmines has dropped considerably. For over three decades, UNDP has worked alongside the government and communities of the Kingdom of Cambodia to advance mine action efforts,” he added.

These undertakings have significantly reduced the country’s mine-affected areas, enabling rural development, economic growth and the transformation of former battlegrounds into productive land for farming and community use.
