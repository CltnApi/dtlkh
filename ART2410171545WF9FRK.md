# Ream Naval Base Not For China; US Warships Welcome At Cambodia’s Beijing Aided Port – Deputy PM

Amid concerns that the Ream Naval Base might be used by the People Liberation Army Navy (PLAN) as a military outpost, Cambodia has said that US ships would also be permitted to visit the base.

Assuaging concerns, Cambodia’s Deputy Prime Minister Sun Chanthol said that once the naval facility is completed, any nation’s military could visit the Ream Port. He was addressing an event hosted by the Washington-based think tank Center for Strategic and International Studies.

“The Ream Naval Base is not for the Chinese. The Chinese provided us with the assistance to expand the Ream Naval Base for our national defense, not to be used by the Chinese or any military against another country,” Sun said at the event. “When this naval base is completed, any navy can call on that port, as long as it’s for humanitarian and disaster recovery or joint military exercise.”
