# HIV authorities seek undiagnosed people living with illness

A delegation led by Ieng Mouly, chair of the National AIDS Authority (NAA), recently travelled to Thailand to discuss pathways to ensuring that Cambodian migrant workers in Thailand will receive access to testing and treatment. NAA

The National AIDS Authority (NAA) is currently collaborating with local and international partners to identify an estimated 8,000 individuals who are unknowingly living with HIV.

The vital task is part of its ultimate goal of diagnosing each of the people living with HIV in the Kingdom and making them aware of their status so they can access treatment.

Chhim Khin Dareth, NAA secretary-general, stated that as of 2023, it was estimated that Cambodia has 76,000 people living with HIV. However, by the second quarter of 2024, only 68,000 people have sought treatment within the healthcare system.

“We believe that around 8,000 people are unaware of their HIV status. Some may be afraid to get tested due to concerns or fear of the results. Many still don’t know they are infected,” he explained, adding that some may seek care outside the system, such as through private clinics or hospitals, to maintain anonymity.

The NAA is conducting studies and creating partnerships with the Ministry of Health and other relevant stakeholders to gather information on these 8,000 individuals.

“We are working on strategies to encourage these individuals to come forward for testing. We do not yet have clear information on where they are. Some might not know their status, or they may be receiving services from places outside our system,” he said. 

Senior Minister Ieng Mouly, NAA chair, recently led an inter-ministerial delegation and provincial authorities from Banteay Meanchey and Pailin on a visit to hospitals in Thailand’s Sa Kaeo and Chanthaburi provinces.

During a visit to Pong Nam Ron Hospital in Chanthaburi, Monsit Paisarnthanawat, governor of the province, emphasied the importance of strengthening healthcare cooperation between the two countries, especially in managing HIV among migrant workers, according to the NAA. 

Mouly explained that the visits aimed to explore new pathways for cooperation in managing HIV transmissions among Cambodian migrant workers in Thailand.

“In Cambodia, we estimate around 76,000 people are living with HIV, and about 68,000 are receiving care. This means approximately 8,000 people are missing from the system. They may be seeking treatment in private hospitals or be migrant workers,” he said.

The NAA added that it hopes that future discussions with their Thai counterparts will lead to an agreement that allows Cambodian workers in Thailand to access testing and treatment in Thai hospitals.

Dareth also mentioned that only a small percentage of patients in the system have stopped treatment. In the first quarter of 2024, around 0.92 per cent discontinued treatment, possibly due to migration.

“Sometimes, patients move and stop accessing services. Some of them were receiving treatment in Cambodia but have since migrated to Thailand. We aim to cooperate with Thai health authorities to ensure they receive testing and care there,” he said. 

The Cambodian government approved the National Policy on Ending AIDS and the Sustainability of the AIDS Programme for 2023-2028 in March. 

Dareth noted that it is unlikely that HIV will be eliminated, so a sustainable response is required. He explained that Cambodia is working hard focusing on sustainability and reducing new infections to about 200 cases per year, reducing AIDS-related deaths to below 200 annually, and eliminating stigma and discrimination.

Locating the 8,000 individuals outside the system is part of Cambodia's push toward achieving the 95-95-95 national targets by 2025, which aim for 95 per cent of people living with HIV to know their status, 95 per cent to be receiving antiretroviral treatment (ART) and for 95 per cent of ART patients to show reduced viral loads.

Dareth highlighted that Cambodia has already reached the second and third 95 per cent targets but is still working to achieve the first.

“What we are pushing for is for people who do not yet know their \[HIV\] status to enter the service system so that we are aware of them. At present, we have achieved 89 per cent of the first goal and exceeded the target for the second and third,” he said.

Testing and treatment for HIV in Cambodia are provided free of charge. Dareth urged individuals who suspect they may have been exposed to the virus to come forward for testing and any necessary care.
