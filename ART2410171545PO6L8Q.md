The agriculture ministry organised an event to mark World Food Day in Kep province on October 16, in collaboration with the Food and Agriculture Organization of the UN (FAO) and World Food Programme (WFP). FAO

The Kingdom marked yesterday’s international World Food Day with a commemoration event at Kep Stadium, located in the eponymous town and province.

The celebrations, which honoured this year’s theme, “Right to Foods for a Better Life and a Better Future”, were led by the Ministry of Agriculture Forestry and Fisheries, in collaboration with the Food and Agriculture Organization of the UN (FAO) and World Food Programme (WFP).

The theme served as a timely reminder that all people have the right to adequate and nutritious foods, emphasising the need for food diversity, availability, accessibility and affordability for all, according to an FAO press release.  

The FAO highlighted the importance of “foods” in the plural, signifying the need for diverse diets that can sustain and improve the quality of life of all people.

The statement explained that while the world’s farmers produce more than enough calories to feed the global population, around 730 million people still face hunger due to man-made and natural disasters, including conflict, recurrent weather shocks, inequalities and economic downturns. 

In addition, over 2.8 billion people cannot afford a healthy diet, contributing to malnutrition and affecting the quality of life for almost a third of the world’s population.

Agriculture ministry secretary of state Toch Bunhour addressed the October 16 event. 

“On the occasion of the 44th World Food Day 2024, we come together with the theme 'Right to Foods for a Better Life and a Better Future,' recognising the critical need to combat hunger, promote food security and ensure healthy diets for everyone. It is essential that all stakeholders actively engage in eradicating poverty and achieving Zero Hunger, both globally and within Cambodia,” he said.

The event also featured an exhibition of agricultural production activities, nutrition programmes and value-added initiatives from across the Kingdom, as well as remarks from several key officials and stakeholders.

Among them were Hour Methona, deputy governor of Kep Province, Meng Chan Thoeurn, representative and programme coordinator at WFP, and Ehsan Kabir, communication specialist at FAO.

In his address, Kabir emphasised the importance of transforming systems to ensure that diverse, nutritious foods are accessible to all. 

“Collective action can create meaningful change, and it requires collaboration from all sectors – governments, businesses, academia, civil society and individuals. The youth, especially, have a crucial role in shaping a food-secure future; their efforts today will influence the outcomes of tomorrow,” he explained.

“Farmers, through sustainable practices, businesses, by making nutritious food more accessible, and academia and civil society, by holding leaders accountable and applying science for progress, all have important roles to play. Our actions are our future,” he added.

Additional representatives from the government, private sector, development partners and wider community were also present.

“The event concluded with a symbolic tree planting ceremony, representing efforts to protect and sustainably manage food resources. Farmers were also provided with tree seedlings for planting in their communities, reinforcing the commitment to building a resilient environment for future food production,” added the statement.

The FAO called upon everyone – government, the private sector, academia, civil society and individuals – to act collectively to transform global agrifood systems, ensuring they support the Four Betters: better production, better nutrition, a better environment and a better life. 

“Together, we can achieve the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development by honouring everyone’s right to varied and nutritious foods, leaving no one behind,” it added.
