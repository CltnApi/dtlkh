The government has launched a new feature for its popular “Single Portal” system.

The government has launched a new feature for its popular “Single Portal” system.

A new update will enable companies and enterprises which are registered through the portal – which runs on the Cambodia Data eXchange (CamDX) platform – to update key information, as well remove themselves from the business registry, if necessary.

The new feature, part of the second phase of the platform, was officially announced on November 26, and has six specific functions. 

They include five options to update or modify company details: Company or enterprise name changes, administrative details, business owners, shareholders and branch or foreign representative details, as well as the ability to deregister themselves.

A statement explained that the changes reflect the government’s commitment to promoting a digital transformation in public service delivery, with the goal of creating a more business-friendly environment in Cambodia and enhancing the Kingdom’s global competitiveness. 

The Single Portal system was designed to reduce costs, save time and simplify access to public services for the businesses and enterprises which registered with it.

It was first launched in June of 2020, with the participation of six government institutions: The ministries of interior, finance, commerce and labour, as well as the General Department of Taxation and the Council for the Development of Cambodia.

More ministries and institutions were added in major updates in September 2021 and June 2023.

Since June 2020, approximately 40,000 companies and enterprises have been registered through the Single Portal system, with a total investment capital of over $14 billion. 

Additionally, around 27,000 licenses, permits and certificates in various industries have been issued by government institutions within the electronic business ecosystem.

Hong Vanak, an economist at the Royal Academy of Cambodia, told _The Post_ on November 27 that he believed the new features would provide several benefits to both the private sector and the government.

He noted that for the private sector, the ability to update company information is highly convenient, eliminating the need for lengthy procedures. It also helps reduce unofficial expenses, making it easier for business owners to keep their records up to date. 

For the government, Vanak believed the new features would provide more accurate and up-to-date information on the company's management, location and status.

“This is another advancement by the government in reducing bureaucratic procedures related to company registration and data correction. By simplifying these processes, the government hopes to attract more businesses to register, including those that have not yet done so. This change is also expected to encourage people looking to start new businesses to register more easily,” he added.

Chhin Ken, president of the Cambodia Digital Tech Association (CDTA), suggested that enhancing business laws, simplifying registration procedures and improving the technology knowledge of business owners have encouraged more businesses to register. 

When all businesses are properly registered and recognised by the authorities, it will help make competition more transparent, he added.

“When all businesses are registered, it will provide numerous benefits to both the government and the private sector. It will also help reduce the issue of unfair competition, as some unregistered businesses engage in illegal practices like tax evasion. Clear and reliable data about the type and status of businesses is crucial for the government to implement supportive or incentivising policies,” he explained.
