Hundreds of victims of the alleged pyramid-scheme operator iCon Group have emerged in Laos, Myanmar, Cambodia and Japan, while the number of complainants in Thailand passed the 500 mark.

On Sunday, police said the number of people who had filed complaints with the Central Investigation Bureau against the iCon Group were more than 500 so far, with claimed damages of more than 200 million baht.

Thai victims have told police that they were lured to become dealers or distributors of the firm’s supplementary food products with the promise that the products would sell like hotcakes. But they ended up failing to sell the products and were told instead to recruit more “dealers” to work under them so they could earn part of new recruits’ investment money.
