# Cambodian economy projected to grow 5.5% in 2024: IMF

The IMF has projected that the Cambodian economy will grow by 5.5 per cent in 2024, up from 5 per cent last year, driven by a strong rebound in garment and agricultural exports and tourism recovery.

The International Monetary Fund (IMF) recently projected that the Cambodian economy will grow by 5.5 per cent in 2024, up from 5 per cent last year, driven by a strong rebound in garment and agricultural exports and the underway recovery in tourism.

Inflation in the country is projected to reach around 1.5 per cent this year before converging to the long-term trend of 3 per cent, the IMF said after concluding its 2024 Article IV consultation mission to the country recently.

Inflation has moderated to an average of 1.6 per cent year on year in the first half of 2024, down from 2.1 per cent in 2023.
