The Cambodian national team take part in a training run one day ahead of tonight’s friendly with Chinese Taipei at the National Olympic Stadium. CPL

With just five days as Cambodia’s new head coach, Japanese tactician Koji Gyotoku is determined to lead his team to victory against Chinese Taipei in tonight’s 7.00pm international friendly at the National Olympic Stadium.

The match marks Koji's first match in charge of the Kouprey team after replacing Felix Dalmas, whose contract was terminated on September 13.

Despite limited preparation time, Koji is clear about his intentions for the upcoming clash. While acknowledging being given a short window to organise the team, he remains focused on understanding his players' strengths and potential.

 “We have had very little time to prepare the team, so what I’m trying to do is to learn about the players – what they are capable of and what level they can play at,” he told a Thursday press conference.

“For this match, we aim to maintain our attacking style and build on what we’ve been working on so far,” he explained.

Koji noted that while the team’s results in recent matches have been underwhelming, he wants to restore the players’ confidence and deliver a victory that will also please the Cambodian fans.

“We want to win, just like our supporters do,” he said.

“The recent losses have affected the players' confidence, but I’ve noticed that the team is coming together better now. We have some talented players, and I believe they’ll perform better in this match,” he added.

One of the standout players, defender Soeuy Visal, also highlighted the team’s commitment to improving their performance for the fans.

“We are fully determined to give our best for the supporters,” said Visal. “We understand their disappointment when we lose, and as players, we share that same feeling.”

Meanwhile, Chinese Taipei’s coach Gary White acknowledged the strength of Cambodia’s current squad, especially the young emerging talent and newly naturalised players. 

However, he was confident that his team, with their physical advantages, can secure the win.

“We’ve done our homework on Cambodia, and we’ll use our strengths to outplay them,” he said.

“Our players have great physicality, and we will focus on using that to dominate the game,” he added.

White also revealed that his team has been working on new tactics ahead of this match. "We’ve introduced a new style of play for the team," he explained. "This game will be a test for our players as we aim to prepare them for even tougher matches ahead. We expect them to adapt and perform accordingly.”

As Cambodia seeks to regain their competitive edge, all eyes will be on tonight’s showdown to see whether Koji can mastermind a quick turnaround and deliver a long-awaited victory for the national team. 

With the backing of the Kingdom’s passionate fans, the Kouprey will be eager to prove their worth and put their disappointing run behind them.
