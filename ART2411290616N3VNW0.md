A government initiative designed to keep children from impoverished households will begin registration next week.

Once registered, students from families that qualify for ID Poor cards will receive a monthly stipend, with payments beginning at the end of January.

The scheme aims to encourage children to enrol early and remain at school until they complete their secondary studies, explained the National Social Assistance Fund (NSAF).

The scholarship programme is part of the “National Social Assistance Programme for Families” package, officially launched by the Cambodian government in April of this year.

The NSAF, which is overseen by the Ministry of Social Affairs, Veterans and Youth Rehabilitation, announced on November 27 that guardians or students from families holding level one or two equity cards should begin registering from December 1, to implement the programme for primary and secondary students from poor households in a timely and effective manner.

To register, students must meet with the programme officers at the school where they study.

They should bring the original equity card, as well as a letter that confirms they are enrolled in the programme.

The NSAF has confirmed that the first round of stipend disbursements will occur on January 30, 2025. Primary and lower-secondary students will receive 20,000 riel (around $5) per month, while upper-secondary students will receive 30,000 riel ($7.50).

The fund has advised students to update their details at the start of each academic year, and reminded them that 80 per cent attendance is required to qualify for the payments.

The family package integrates four major programmes, which support pregnant women and new others, impoverished students, people with disabilities and elderly citizens.

Financial support for pregnant women and children under two years old currently benefits about 370,000 individuals, while the scholarships for poor primary and secondary students supported over 260,000 students in 2024. It is estimated that the figure will grow to 450,000 beneficiaries in 2025.

More than 20,000 people with disabilities receive financial assistance, along with approximately 300,000 individuals over the age of 60.

According to the National Social Protection Council (NSPCN), the coverage provided by the social protection system has more than doubled since 2017, and currently benefits over seven million citizens. 

National expenditure on social protection has tripled, with a total budget allocation exceeding $4.3 billion since the National Social Protection Policy Framework was adopted in 2017.
