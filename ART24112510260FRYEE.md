The Kingdom’s aviation sector has experienced consistent growth this year, with Cambodia’s three international airports — Phnom Penh, Siem Reap and Sihanoukville — handling over 47,000 flights in the first ten months of the year, a 10% increase compared to the same period in 2023. 

The number of passengers passing through these airports reached almost 5 million, a remarkable year-on-year of more than a fifth.

Chea Chandara, president of the Logistics and Supply Chain Business Association in Cambodia (LOSCBA), told _The Post_ on November 25 that the rise in flights and air cargo over the past two years follows a sharp decline between 2020 and 2022 due to the Covid-19 pandemic. With the global economy recovering, the demand for air travel and goods transportation is expected to continue to grow in 2025.

He explained that as global economic conditions improve, investments and tourism will increase, resulting in greater demand for flights. He emphasised that there are no signs suggesting a decline in air transport in 2025, and Cambodia’s export market will continue to grow, bringing in more cargo flights.

According to data from the Civil Aviation Secretariat, the kingdom’s international airports collectively saw 47,447 incoming and outgoing flights from January to October 2024, marking a 14% increase over the same period in 2023. Meanwhile, the number of passengers passing through the airports during the same period totalled 4,978,663, a 21% rise. Air freight also saw a significant increase, with more than 63,000 tonnes of goods transported, up 37% over 2023.

In October 2024 alone, the airports recorded 4,799 flights, a 10% rise from October 2023. The number of passengers increased by nearly 20%, reaching 530,988, while air cargo increased by 17%, totaling 6,670 tonnes.

Khiev Thy, president of the Angkor Tourism Association, acknowledged the uptick in both flight numbers and foreign arrivals. He expressed optimism for continued growth in 2025, assuming no global disruptions like the pandemic or political conflicts.

Last month, aviation secretariat spokesperson Sin Chansereyvutha told the Post that the secretariat is working diligently to establish more air connections. Recently, Cambodia and Turkey held discussions about direct flights.

Chansereyvutha added that Cambodia is actively building new airports and improving infrastructure to facilitate smoother operations and enhance the country’s ability to attract more international tourists.

In the first three quarters of 2024, Cambodia welcomed 4.8 million international tourists, marking a 22.2% increase over the previous year.
