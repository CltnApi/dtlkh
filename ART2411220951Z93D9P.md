Prime Minister Hun Manet hailed the revival of Cambodia’s quarrying industry as his administration’s first major accomplishment, achieved within a month of his assuming the role of premier.

Speaking at the conclusion of the Ministry of Mines and Energy’s annual meeting, he highlighted the sector’s remarkable turnaround.

“The quarrying sector was the first of the solutions offered during my term as prime minister that bore fruit,” he noted. 

“This year, the momentum has completely shifted, with the sector growing fourfold from September 2023 to September 2024,” he added.

He said that in September 2023, during an exhibition in Nanning, China, he was informed that the sector was on the verge of collapse, with factories gradually closing. 

Manet attributed the successful turnaround to a comprehensive strategy that involved addressing challenges holistically. 

Key elements included policy reforms, the removal of bureaucratic hurdles and fostering collaboration between the government and the private sector, he explained.

Manet emphasised that the measures taken to revive the sector could serve as a blueprint for resolving challenges in other industries.

“This issue is a model of devising solutions, and I hope that in the future it will be applied to other sectors,” he said.

Manet highlighted three key factors driving the success of the quarry revival. First, the government implemented clear and firm mechanisms to regularly address challenges faced by the private sector. 

Second, officials ensured enforcement was honest, fair and free from corruption or unnecessary bureaucratic obstacles. 

Lastly, the private sector collaborated by complying with tax regulations and maintaining solidarity with government efforts.

“If we only address the customs rate but allow other burdens to persist, this sector will still collapse. Both government officials and the private sector must work together honestly to ensure success,” added the prime minister, as he noted the importance of integrity on both sides. 

Reflecting on the achievement, he expressed personal pride in the sector’s growth and hinted at its place in his broader legacy. 

“The stone quarry sector is my pride. One day, I will write a book about my experience when I retire, and perhaps this sector will be one of the chapters I remember,” he said.

The prime minister credited the success to robust monitoring, clarity and flexibility in government measures, combined with honest and united efforts by both public and private stakeholders.

Minister of Mines and Energy Keo Rottanak emphasised that reducing bureaucratic hurdles to support the private sector and improve public services has significantly streamlined processes and enhanced fair competition, based on established rules and principles.

“This approach has resulted in non-tax revenues from the mining sector reaching nearly $90 million in 2024, a 170 per cent increase on 2023 and approximately 150 per cent of the target set in the government’s 2024 budget,” he explained.

The minister credited Manet’s reforms in the export processes of sawn stone and sand as pivotal to this success.

The quarry sector, which encompasses natural stones, whether extracted in blocks, slabs, smaller pieces (like gravel) or sand, plays a crucial role in construction and decorative applications. Growing demand for these materials is making a significant contribution to Cambodia’s economic progress.
