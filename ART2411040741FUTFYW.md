A traditional Kathin procession, which was initiated by Prime Minister Hun Manet, is expected to arrive at Wat Pothikiri Vongsa Ram, also called Wat Svay Siem Thmey, in Tra Vinh Province (formerly Preah Trapeang), South Vietnam, this afternoon.

The ceremony marks the first government-organised Kathin ceremony to the region since 1949, reflecting the growing unity among Khmer people, said historians.

Kathin is a Buddhist festival that comes at the end of the rainy season. Traditionally, Theravada Buddhist monks spend the rainy season in retreat at their pagodas and this festival marks the end of that period.

This event, named the “Grand Khmer Family Unity Kathin,” was attended by Cambodian government officials from the Senate, National Assembly and the Royal Government. Led by Bun Rany, the prime minister’s mother, the ceremony is scheduled to conclude on the morning of November 5.

Southern Vietnam, or Kampuchea Krom, was ceded to Vietnam by the French in 1949. It is still home to 461 Buddhist pagodas, with Tra Vinh alone hosting 143. According to National Television of Cambodia (TVK), donations from the Kathin ceremony will be allocated to Wat Pothikiri Vongsa Ram and the other 142 pagodas in Tra Vinh.

History professor Diep Sophal explained that traditional Kathin ceremonies are usually family-led events. However, this event is distinctive, as it is a government-led initiative with participation from various levels of Cambodia’s leadership.

“This ceremony shows the government’s care for all Khmer people, regardless of location – be it central, upper or southern Khmer communities and even Khmer overseas. It highlights national unity and solidarity,” he said.

Rath Sandab, a Khmer cultural expert, noted that this is the first time the Cambodian government has organised such a Kathin ceremony since 1949.
