Environment minister Eang Sophalleth addresses the Cambodia Climate Change Forum 2024, held in Preah Sihanouk province, on October 24. Environment ministry

Minister of Environment, Eang Sophalleth, has warned that human activities are contributing to climate change, which is resulting in more frequent and severe weather, including heatwaves, heavy rainfall and droughts.

He shared his statement as he addressed the Cambodia Climate Change Forum 2024 (CCCF24), which is taking place in Preah Sihanouk province’s Sihanoukville from October 24 to 25, according to the Ministry of Environment.

The forum, organised by the ministry, in cooperation with the Mekong Future Initiative (MFI), has attracted more than 300 participants, including senior government officials, diplomats, civil servants, development partners, climate experts, private sector representatives, civil society organisations and both national and international guests.

“Therefore, at the global level, what we must do is implement measures for mitigation and adaptation, build the resilience of vulnerable communities to the impacts of climate change and commit to the $100 billion climate finance target to support developing countries,” added Sophalleth, who also chairs the National Council for Sustainable Development.

The minister noted that the meeting reflects the strong cooperation and solidarity between the ministry, public and private sectors, and development partners, demonstrating Cambodia’s commitment to addressing climate change, which is a global challenge.

“Cambodia is highly vulnerable to climate change, and the rise in temperature is expected to reduce productivity in agriculture, fisheries and forestry, as well as in many other sectors across the country,” he emphasised.

He used the occasion to reiterate that Cambodia has called on national and international stakeholders to intensify their efforts in tackling climate change, which poses a growing threat to human well-being and the health of the planet.

The minister explained that the ministry is focusing on practical steps, such as implementing the newly adopted Environment and Natural Resources Code and advancing initiatives like the national reforestation campaign, which aims to plant one million trees annually. These efforts are integral to achieving the long-term goal of carbon neutrality by 2050.

“The success of our campaigns, Today I Will Not Use Plastic and the Phnom Penh Declaration on Plastic Waste, show that collective action works,” he said. 

The forum will contribute to Cambodia’s preparations for the upcoming 29th UN Framework Convention on Climate Change Conference (COP29) in November. The event was inaugurated by Sophalleth, Jason Kalbfleisch, acting deputy chief of mission from the US embassy, Derek Yip, Australian ambassador to Cambodia, and Dominic Williams, British ambassador to Cambodia.

The forum is primarily sponsored by USAID, with additional support from the Australian Embassy.

Kalbfleisch said the US government, through USAID, is honoured to be the forum’s lead sponsor, with a focus on supporting coastal communities in Cambodia to adapt to the impacts of climate change, according to a joint press release. 

“Over the past three decades, the US government has invested more than $53 billion in Cambodia's development with, over $100 million in the last six years aimed at combating climate change,” he explained.

He explained that at the forum they will showcase five USAID projects that emphasise locally developed solutions, innovative climate financing, and the crucial role of youth and indigenous communities in long-term climate strategies.

“Together, we are advancing efforts to promote sustainable livelihoods and climate smart agriculture, helping Cambodia meet its climate goals under the Paris Agreement," he added. 

Yip underlined in the press release that climate change is an existential threat to the region and explained how Australia is strengthening its climate cooperation in Cambodia. 

“We are increasing access to climate-resilient water and sanitation services for rural Cambodians, supporting climate-smart innovations in agriculture and working with energy officials to support the clean energy transition,” he said.
