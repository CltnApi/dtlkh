# Caught between giants: Why Cambodia looks to Australia

 ![](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f4a538ca-3572-4a8f-8e27-630671bcaea1)

With Phnom Penh aiming to diversify its strategic options, Canberra seems like a good bet.

At first glance, Cambodia and Australia might not seem like major players in each other’s diplomatic orbits. But watch this space.

Over the past decades, Canberra has been a key partner in Cambodia’s development, collaborating closely on economic and governance initiatives. To further strengthen ties, Phnom Penh could upgrade its relationship with Australia to a Comprehensive Strategic Partnerships (CSP) — the highest diplomatic tier in Phnom Penh’s foreign relations. This would make Australia the third country, behind China (in 2010) and Japan (in 2013), to achieve CSP status.

Upgrading Cambodian-Australian ties could enhance strategic and diplomatic engagement, supporting Cambodia’s goal of foreign policy diversification. Doing so would also align with Australia’s Southeast Asia Economic Strategy, recognising the region’s importance for its future growth and stability.
