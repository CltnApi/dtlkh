The Ministry of Commerce, in collaboration with the Norwegian embassy, organised a workshop in Phnom Penh aimed at enhancing the understanding of officials and stakeholders on how to maximise the benefits of Norway's Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) for Cambodian exports.

The workshop was opened by commerce minister Cham Nimul and attended by Norwegian ambassador to Cambodia Astrid Emilie Helle who is based in Thailand, along with various institutional representatives.

Nimul expressed gratitude to the ambassador for initiating and supporting the workshop, highlighting that it offers timely business and investment opportunities as relations between the two countries strengthen.

Through Norway’s GSP system, Cambodian exporters can benefit from duty-free entry for all Cambodian-origin products that meet the rules of origin and other GSP criteria.

The Norwegian embassy shared on social media that Nimul and Helle discussed ways to strengthen economic and political relations between the two nations, exploring opportunities to further enhance these ties in the future.

The Norwegian Customs Directorate (Tolletaten) previously conducted a seminar on how Cambodian businesses could export to Norway duty-free under the GSP framework.

Under the category least developed country (LDC), Cambodia is eligible for tax exemptions on exports to Norway through the GSP. However, bilateral trade remains relatively low, with commerce between the two countries reaching only $6.71 million in 2022, according to _Trading Economics_.
