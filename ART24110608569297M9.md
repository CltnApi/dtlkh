As the world watches the US presidential elections, the Associated Press has called 267 Electoral College votes for Republican candidate Donald Trump. 

With at least three votes due from the as-yet uncounted state of Alaska, his victory over Democratic candidate Kamala Harris is all but assured.

Trump took to the stage at his Florida election-watch party to declare himself the winner.

“We’ve achieved the most incredible political thing, political victory, that our country has never seen before - nothing like this,” he said.

He also claimed to have won the popular vote, although that has not been determined.

“Thank you very much. Winning the popular vote was very nice, very nice, I will tell you,” he added.

Various global leaders rushed to congratulate the sometimes controversial former reality TV host, with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu also sending his encouragement, calling Trump’s projected win “history’s greatest comeback”, and French President Emmanuel Macron congratulating Trump on X.

“Congratulations, President Trump. Ready to work together as we did for four years. With your convictions and mine. With respect and ambition. For more peace and prosperity,” he wrote.

UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer also shared his best wishes, via a social media statement.

“From growth and security to innovation and tech, I know that the UK-US special relationship will continue to prosper on both sides of the Atlantic for years to come,” he said.

Nayib Bukele, president of El Salvador, and Trump ally Jair Bolsonaro, former Brazilian president also rushed to share their pleasure, with Bolsonaro hailing the “resurgence of a true warrior” after what he called his ally’s “epic victory” in the US election

Trump described the election result as giving him a “great feeling of love” and claimed America has given him “a powerful mandate”.

The official results may not be confirmed for some time, but initial projections suggest that the Republican Party has also gained control of the US Senate and House of Representatives.
