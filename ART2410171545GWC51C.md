Renowned international choir, Musica Felice, is back to light up the stage with their 13th Charity Concert, "Music & Soul," scheduled for this Sunday, October 20. 

This much-loved musical event has become a highlight of Phnom Penh’s cultural scene, drawing together music lovers from across the city.

This year’s concert promises a dynamic blend of songs, ranging from timeless classics by Édith Piaf to modern hits from Alicia Keys, with a few surprises to keep the audience captivated. 

Adding to the excitement is a live performance of scenes from the iconic movie and musical Dreamgirls, brought to life by a talented cast of actors.

Held in the stunning Grand Ballroom of Sofitel Phnom Penh Phokeethra, which is co-hosting the event, “Music & Soul” is a family-friendly evening aimed at both entertainment and charity. 

Ticket donations range from $3 to $30, and all proceeds will go towards supporting two local Cambodian organisations which are dedicated to helping children and youth in need.

“We’re thrilled to bring such a wide variety of soulful music to the stage, all in the name of supporting a great cause,” says Miwako Fujiwara, founder, conductor and producer of Musica Felice. 

“Our choir and actors have been working tirelessly to ensure the audience enjoys an inspiring and unforgettable performance,” she adds.

This year's production features 28 choir members and 10 actors, representing 19 different nationalities, all of whom have volunteered over the past three months to prepare for this special night. 

“I’m so proud to have such a diverse group contributing their time and talents, not only to celebrate the arts but to help provide new opportunities for Cambodian children and youth,” Fujiwara says.

Musica Felice, a registered local NGO in Cambodia, has been dedicated to philanthropy since its inception in 2017, and has raised nearly $117,000 for local causes.

One of this concert's beneficiaries is The Rabbit School Organization, which has been educating and advocating for children with intellectual disabilities and autism in Cambodia for over 25 years. 

The school operates in 16 locations, providing specialised education to over 700 students with special needs. 

As the demand for their services continues to rise, Touch Hun, executive director and founder, expressed gratitude for the support of the music community.

“Musica Felice’s contribution will not only provide vital financial aid but also help spread awareness of our mission to ensure equal education for all children, regardless of their abilities,” he said.

The second beneficiary is Project Khmer H.O.P.E., an organisation dedicated to improving the lives of orphans and disadvantaged children by providing them with vocational training and skills which open doors to employment opportunities, helping break the cycle of poverty.

“We’re honored to be chosen as a beneficiary of Musica Felice’s concert,” says Susan Goh, head of centre and hospitality. 

“Their support will truly make a difference as we continue to create brighter futures for Cambodia’s youth.”

The concert begins at 4:30 p.m. on Sunday, October 20, 2024. For more information and to donate and get tickets, visit [www.musicafelice.org/concert/13](https://www.musicafelice.org/concert/13).
