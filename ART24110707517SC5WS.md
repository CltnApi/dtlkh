Cambodia is likely to become an ageing society before it reaches high-income status by 2050, necessitating clear policies to address the needs of its older population and related social issues.

HelpAge Cambodia and the Cambodian Older People Network organised the 4th National Forum on Older People on November 6 to strengthen relationships and enhance the work of elderly associations nationwide.

The forum brought together 247 elderly representatives from across the country and aimed to review and discuss the progress and vision of relevant ministries and institutions focused on the ageing sector to address the priority needs of older people in Cambodia.

According to the 2019 Population Census, the country has over 1.3 million elderly people, accounting for approximately 8.9 per cent of the population. This figure is projected to rise to 1.9 million, or 11 per cent, by 2030. 

By 2050, the country’s elderly population is expected to exceed five million, making up about 23 per cent of the total population.

The UN classifies a country as an "ageing society" when 20 per cent or more of its population is aged 60 and above.

Data from the UN Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (UN-ESCAP) reveals that in 2024, the country’s elderly population reached 1,500,000, or 10 per cent of the current population.

HelpAge Cambodia executive director Tum Vireak noted that the country’s elderly population growth trend aligns with similar patterns in the region and globally.

“Cambodia is likely to become an aged society before becoming a high-income country, which necessitates policies, protection programmes and effective measures to support not only the elderly but also the youth, who will eventually reach old age,” HelpAge stated in a press release.

According to a report by the UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs (UNDESA), globally, the number of people aged 60 and over reached approximately one billion in 2019. This number is expected to grow to around 1.4 billion by 2030 and 2.1 billion by 2050.

“In Cambodia, the rise in the elderly population and the decline in the younger population could significantly impact the social protection system, including social security and welfare systems, potentially leading to economic disadvantages. 

This includes a decrease in productivity, labour and income, while expenses increase, placing a heavier burden on society and families,” the release said.

Forum participants have previously proposed that the government provide a universal pension for all elderly people, free healthcare services, social welfare cards for the general elderly population, start-up capital or occupational programmes for older individuals and caregiving initiatives for the elderly.
