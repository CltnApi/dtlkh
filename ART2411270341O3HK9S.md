The comprehensive analysis of public administration currently underway is not intended to impose additional burdens or remove officials from ministries and state institutions. Instead, it presents an opportunity to provide essential technical support to modernise Cambodia's public administration system, as highlighted by Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Civil Service Hun Many.

Many made the remarks during a November 26 press conference at the Royal School of Administration, addressing the implementation of “Key Measure 2” in civil service reform: the review and analysis of functions and organisational structures within ministries and institutions.

The press conference aimed to broaden public awareness and understanding of the initiative among civil servants and the public. This follows earlier consultations conducted by the ministry with nine ministries and institutions, concluding on November 7. 

These included the Council of Ministers and the ministries of Interior, Education, Youth and Sport, Economy and Finance, Social Affairs, Veterans and Youth Rehabilitation, Justice, Health, Urban Planning and Construction and Labour and Vocational Training.

The minister's remarks sought to allay concerns among some officials over potential loss of benefits following the issuance of guidelines by the ministry in May. This framework outlined the process for reviewing and analysing functions and organisational structures across ministries and institutions.

As vice-chair of the National Committee for Public Administration Reform Implementation, Many stated, “We must ensure there is no misunderstanding that the analysis of functions involves reorganisation or removal of roles that could affect officials' duties and benefits.”

“The purpose of the analysis is to enhance efficiency within ministries and institutions. Misconceptions that this process involves reducing positions or benefits could create unnecessary anxiety,” he explained.

This requires clear communication and sufficient time for explanation and reassurance within each ministry and institution to alleviate such concerns, he added.

Many emphasised that the analysis serves as an opportunity to assess the current state of the public administration system, identifying strengths and areas for improvement. The collected data will provide a foundation for future improvements in organisational efficiency. 

He noted that during the initial phase of the operation in May, there was limited understanding of the process. However, after discussions at technical, political and institutional levels, understanding has significantly improved.

He also highlighted that previous reforms have never resulted in the loss of benefits for civil servants. In the seventh mandate, the government remains committed to preserving their legal rights and benefits.

The process requires ministries to independently complete foundational documents provided by the civil service ministry and submit their reports. The ministry will then compile the data and present it to Prime Minister Hun Manet, who chairs the reform committee, for further guidance.

The minister expressed confidence in the professionalism and transparency of the data collection process. He said collaboration and consultation among ministries will ensure the data’s accuracy and reliability.

He noted that while some ministries previously requested structural expansions or additional staff, under the seventh mandate, relevant ministries must complete analyses before considering such expansions.

“Without a clear functional analysis, no new officers can be recruited,” he said. 

Many added that the recent hiring of new officers was based on a framework approved in 2023, but approval for new officer recruitment for 2024 and 2025 is not yet available.

Acting on government advice, the ministry has established a technical working group to collaborate with ministries and institutions. This group is divided into four sectors: general administration (10 ministries and institutions), security and public order (two ministries), social affairs (nine ministries) and the economic sector (10 ministries and institutions).

The civil service ministry has also organised training courses and workshops to provide technical guidance to management and professional officers responsible for analysing public functions. Additionally, three workshops were held to draw experiences from other countries, including Australia, Singapore and Indonesia.

The prime minister has instructed all ministries and institutions to complete their reviews by the third quarter of 2024.

Ministry of Rural Development spokesperson Pit Karuna stated that their ministry has established a monitoring and evaluation committee to review and analyse its functions and structure. Rural minister Chhay Rithisen has already chaired a meeting to assess the work.

“We focus on reviewing the roles and responsibilities of ministries that overlap or have roles in non-functioning units. Therefore, the ministry has decided to remove any overlapping functions and address any inefficiencies,” he said, adding that the ministry has completed its functional analysis and submitted it to the civil service ministry.

At the closing ceremony of the workshop on "Action Plan 2024-2028 to Implement Key Measures for Public Administration Reform of the Royal Government of the 7th Mandate of the National Assembly" on November 25 in Sihanoukville, Many encouraged officials, “Let us view reform as an opportunity to improve ourselves and our institutions for the better.”
