The Ministry of Environment has fined Mong Reththy Investment Cambodia Oil Palm Co Ltd approximately $10,000 for environmental pollution in Preah Sihanouk province.

The ministry also ordered the company to improve its waste management system by early 2025, according to a letter from environment minister Eang Sophalleth addressed to Okhna Mong Reththy, the company’s CEO.

In the letter dated August 26, concerning law enforcement and pollution improvement measures, which Reththy posted on his social media on November 5, it was noted that the company's second palm oil refinery, located in the province’s Prey Nop district, had discharged liquid waste into the Kampong Seila River, leading to water pollution and fish deaths.

The minister’s letter stated: “In response to this issue and to prevent further environmental pollution, the environment ministry has decided to impose an administrative fine of 40 million riel \[$10,000\].”

The fine addresses four violations: excessive liquid waste discharge beyond the standard limits under Article 6 of Sub-Decree No. 27 on Water Pollution Control, with a fine of 10 million riel \[$2,500\] and insufficient technical capacity of the waste treatment pond to meet required discharge standards, fined under Article 23 of the same sub-decree for another 10 million riel.

Other violations included negligence leading to liquid waste flowing into a public water source, causing pollution and fish deaths, penalised with a further 10 million riel under Article 23 of Sub-Decree No. 27. 

Lastly, the company lacked a permit for liquid waste discharge, incurring an additional 10 million riel fine under Article 10 of the same sub-decree.

The minister directed the company to pay the administrative fine at the ministry by September 19.

The ministry advised the company to “immediately stop releasing untreated liquid waste into the palm plantation or low-lying areas”.

It also instructed the company to establish a reserve pond for storing liquid waste in case of operational issues in the treatment pond to prevent waste from entering public water sources. 

The ministry further required the installation of automated remote monitoring equipment by March 19, 2025 with installation services recognised and approved by the ministry.

The letter warned that, “If the company fails to follow these guidelines, the \[ministry\] will proceed with legal measures as stipulated by law.”

Reththy posted the company’s payment receipt for the fine on September 19.

He said his posts serve as “evidence” in response to a recent accusation that the company was evading responsibility for pollution issues and claimed that the matter had been fully resolved.

“We have permanently repaired the broken embankment, stabilising the situation and compensating the state and affected citizens with full responsibility,” Reththy said in the post.  

He also mentioned that his company directly employs over 2,000 workers and indirectly provides jobs for more than 8,000 others. He noted that the company has significantly contributed to the country’s agricultural and agro-industrial sectors since 1996.

“Do you really want to destroy all that over one minor, unintended incident? Just because of this incident, suddenly, there are numerous so-called patriots eager to undermine our work. I choose not to respond but rather leave it to the ministry to handle according to the law,” he said.

Reththy concluded by stating that he would gladly award a commendation to his critics if they could count, within one year, all the trees he has planted over the past year.

Ministry spokesperson Khvay Atiya stated that the fine applies to companies, factories or enterprises that have caused environmental harm, with no exceptions for legal action. 

He said the ministry is also promoting the installation of self-monitoring equipment and data management systems for waste discharge.

“We are urging factories with pollution potential to comply with applicable laws and environmental standards. This equipment helps reduce toxin release into the community,” he said, adding, “We can monitor this pollution directly from the ministry, making it easy to intervene without requiring factories to report, thereby saving time and inspection costs.”

He noted that the ministry has identified over 120 factories or enterprises that will be equipped with the devices, with nearly 20 already installed.
