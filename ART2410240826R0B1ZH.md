The “Study in Europe Fair 2024”, happening today and tomorrow at Factory Phnom Penh, is expected to attract more than 1,500 keen attendees who are interested in studying in European universities. Anyone who is interested can join free of charge, with prior registration.

The two-day October 24-25 event provides an opportunity for students to explore a wide array of undergraduate and postgraduate programs, exchange opportunities and scholarships from higher education institutions from across Europe.

In attendance are representatives from institutions in Belgium, the Czech Republic, Finland, France, Germany, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Poland, Romania and Slovakia, as well as the European Commission’s Erasmus+ Programme, explained a joint press release between the EU in Cambodia and the Ministry of Education, Youth and Sport.

EU ambassador to Cambodia Igor Driesmans, and education minister Hang Chuon Naron jointly opened the fair, which was attended with diplomats from several European countries.

“It’s a go! Today, I joined Deputy Prime Minister Hang Chuon Naron for the kick-off of the Study in Europe Fair 2024! Great to see so many young people excited to explore the many programmes and learn about scholarships and exchange opportunities with European universities,” said Driesmans, via social media.

Representatives from the Ministry of Industry, Science, Technology and Innovation are also participating and will exchange information with the European universities in attendance.

“Visiting the fair is an excellent opportunity for Cambodian students – and their parents – to discover the various opportunities that European universities offer,” said Driesmans, who added that scholarships are also widely available to support students’ travel to Europe and among European states.

“Europe is the world’s most popular study abroad destination. Our universities offer world-class higher education and value for money. From the Finnish forests, the history-rich towns of Germany and France to the picturesque villages in Italy and Spain, students who study in Europe also have the opportunity to discover the diversity of a continent and the European way-of-life,” he continued.

The education minister also encouraged Cambodian students to go to Europe, enrich their skills and contribute to Cambodian society. He noted that European qualifications are internationally recognised.

“Studying in Europe definitely improves the career prospects of the Cambodian youth. Not only that, European cities are among the most liveable places in the world, with bike lanes and clean air,” He said.

Visitors to the fair will discover study opportunities at over 30 booths and can ask questions directly to fellow Cambodians who studied in Europe, thus learning how studying in Europe changed their lives.

Yeang Donal is an Erasmus Alumni who earned his Master of Science in European Forestry from Wageningen University in the Netherlands, where he learned how he can contribute to Cambodia’s National Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD+) Strategy and social safeguards for local communities.

“Upon my return, I took part in supporting the implementation of Cambodia’s first carbon credit sales project. This initiative successfully attracted major companies to commit to reducing climate change. I contributed to the development of several national policies, including the national REDD+ strategies,” he said at the event.

He urged those who are interested in study in Europe to plan well and be prepared, and grab the opportunity ahead of the others.

AoK Sochenda is an alumna of Stipendium Hungaricum, a Hungarian scholarship programme. While studying in Hungary, she learned about environment protection and is currently an environment content creator with ZEROW. 

“I learned a lot and know more about myself since I left the country and my family. It has made me more self-reliant,” she said.

The EU is the largest contributor to the education sector in Cambodia. The EU and its member states invest more in international cooperation for education than the rest of the world combined, said the joint release.
