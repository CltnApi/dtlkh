Phnom Penh’s art scene will take centre stage once again with the return of Phsar Art, Cambodia’s only dedicated art market, from November 2-3 at The Ground Market in Phnom Penh.

Curated and organised by NOWHERE Art Studio, the two-day fair will gather independent artists, designers and makers, providing a unique platform to showcase Cambodia’s creative talent, according to the organisers.

This year’s theme, “_More Than Just a Market!_”, reflects the event’s aim to build an independent and thriving creative community in Cambodia. Over 60 artists, designers and students will display their work, ranging from contemporary designs to experimental pieces.

The fair will run from 10am to 6pm on both days with free admission, featuring live art demonstrations, workshops and artistic performances alongside vendor stalls offering affordable and unique works of art.

The fair will also include stencil art and watercolour classes, live portrait sessions, demonstrations on repurposing plastic and sustainable fashion workshops.

Organisers emphasise that the fair "is not merely a marketplace, but a space for connection and creative exchange between artists, collectors and the public. It seeks to inspire visitors and highlight the many artistic expressions of Cambodia's expanding art scene”.

Phsar Art was first held from 2017-2019 and returned in 2023 after a break due to the pandemic. Now in its fifth edition, the fair continues to play a crucial role in promoting both established and up-and-coming artists.

Founded by Malaysian and Korean artists Ajin and Lolli in 2014, NOWHERE Art Studio has been actively working to foster a creative community in Phnom Penh. Its mission to support the growth of local artists and foster meaningful connections with international creatives has made Phsar Art a key cultural event, according to the organisers.
