Japan has pledged to continue its partnership and cooperation with Cambodia and increase the trust between the two governments, especially as the number of Japanese investors in Cambodia continues to grow.

During a meeting with Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Manet in Siem Reap on November 25, Japanese Vice-Minister for Foreign Affairs Eri Arfiya expressed her admiration for the achievements Cambodia has made in various sectors over recent years.

She also confirmed the new Japanese government’s ongoing commitment to maintaining a good relationship with Cambodia.

“The partnership and cooperation, as well as trust-building between the governments of Japan and Cambodia, will not only continue but will be further strengthened and expanded,” she said.

Manet congratulated Eri on her appointment and emphasised the strong relationship and cooperation between Cambodia and Japan, which have evolved into a comprehensive strategic partnership. 

He noted that Japan played a significant role in peacebuilding in Cambodia, as well as in the country’s reconstruction and socio-economic development.

The prime minister also reiterated his commitment to further strengthening the relationship and cooperation between the two countries.

Japan and Cambodia have longstanding diplomatic and trade relations, with trade volume between them increasing steadily.

According to data from the General Department of Customs and Excise of Cambodia (GDCE), from January to October this year, the total exchange of trade reached $1.7618 billion, an increase of 17.1% compared to the same period in 2023. 

Cambodian exports to Japan amounted to $1.1506 billion, up 18%, while Japanese imports reached $611.13 million, up 15.5%. Japan is Cambodia’s fifth-largest trading partner, following China, the US, Vietnam and Thailand.

Lim Heng, vice-president of the Cambodia Chamber of Commerce (CCC), told The Post that Japan is an important export market for Cambodia, with Cambodian products mainly consisting of industrial and electrical goods for Japanese factories. In addition to exports, there are now many Japanese investors operating in Cambodia.

He noted that the relationship between the two governments plays an important role in building trust and driving Japanese investment in Cambodia. 

Both countries are members of the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP), which has facilitated Cambodia’s exports to 14 member countries under special customs terms.

“The growing production capacity of Cambodia, along with the benefits from the RCEP trade agreement, will help further increase trade between the two countries, especially exports from Cambodia to Japan,” he said.

Sam Soknoeun, president of the Global Real Estate Association and SAM SN Group, noted that following Manet’s visit to Japan in late 2023, he has observed a growing interest from Japanese investors in direct investment in Cambodia. Both parties are also aiming to establish a Cambodia-Japan Special Economic Zone.

“I believe that in the near future, Cambodia will have new special economic zones, including a Cambodia-Japan Special Economic Zone, which will attract more Japanese companies,” he said.

To promote bilateral trade, the Cambodia Chamber of Commerce, in collaboration with the Japan-Cambodia Chamber of Commerce, organized the “Business Matching Meeting Between Cambodia Chamber of Commerce and Japan-Cambodia Chamber of Commerce 2024” on November 19. 

The event was attended by Sun Chanthol, first vice-president of the Cambodia Development Council (CDC), Takahashi Fumiaki, president of the Japan-Cambodia Chamber of Commerce (and a former ambassador to Cambodia), and about 120 other leaders and members from the two chambers.
