The Ministry of Interior is preparing to implement its Crime Management System (CMS) in the near future, which will expedite information-sharing among relevant law enforcement officers and maintain records of criminal data.

Ministry spokesperson Touch Sokhak told The Post that once the system is operational, all crimes, including traffic violations, will be logged into it, though only offences under the ministry’s jurisdiction will be recorded.

“We aim to manage crime and criminals within the framework of the National Police under the interior ministry so that relevant authorities can access information on whether an individual is under a red notice or has committed other crimes,” he said.

“Previously, if a crime was committed in one province, only the authorities in that province would know, and only those directly handling the case would have the details. This limited access to collective information and reduced the effectiveness of arrests, especially when a criminal fled to another province,” he added.

He noted that law enforcement, from higher-level authorities down to the local level, will be able to track criminals under investigation and access related records.

In the next phase, the ministry may coordinate with other ministries to log crimes that fall under those ministries’ jurisdictions.

In February, Prime Minister Hun Manet also urged relevant agencies to record the names of officials involved in drug-related offences on a blacklist within a set timeframe to prevent individuals connected to drug crimes from obtaining employment elsewhere for a specified period.

He emphasised that the measure does not infringe on human rights but rather protects the community as a whole.
