Cambodia’s processed cashew nuts are being officially exported to the European market for the first time by MIRARTH Agri Tech Co Ltd, marking a significant milestone. This achievement highlights the country’s growing ability to meet EU standards. According to the company, it aims to export 250 tonnes of processed cashew nuts to Europe by the end of 2024.

On November 21, MIRARTH celebrated the inaugural export of its processed cashew nuts to the EU. The ceremony was attended by Samheng Bora, secretary of state at the Ministry of Commerce and chairman of the Export Promotion Task Force, along with a delegation from the commerce ministry, Touch Bun Hour, secretary of state at the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries, leaders from Kampong Thom province and representatives from the Cashew nut Association of Cambodia (CAC).

The commerce ministry stated that this milestone reflects the potential of the country’s cashew processing sector.

"This momentous occasion underscores the ministry’s tireless efforts in identifying and securing international markets for Cambodian products. Through the Export Promotion Task Force and the newly established Export Service Centre – accessible to all interested stakeholders – the ministry continues to support Cambodian companies in achieving export readiness," the ministry announced.

CAC president Uon Silot confirmed to _The Post_ on November 25 that this is the first time processed Cambodian cashew nuts have been officially exported to the EU. He said that MIRARTH, a Japanese-invested company, operates a factory in Chey village of Kampong Thom province’s Kampong Svay district with an annual processing capacity of 15,000 tonnes.

Silot noted that growing international demand for cashew nuts has spurred the establishment of more factories and processing businesses in recent years. He said foreign investors, particularly from China and South Korea, have been collaborating with the CAC to explore opportunities for expanding processing capacity to meet export demands.

He stated, "\[MIRARTH\] gaining the official export right to Europe is a positive achievement, as it means that the quality and hygiene standards of our processed cashew nuts meet international requirements."

Silot mentioned that, according to data from the agriculture ministry, the country currently has around 700,000 hectares of land dedicated to cashew cultivation, with approximately 580,000 being harvested and another 120,000 newly planted. He said the annual yield is between 80,000 to 100,000 tonnes.

According to CAC data, in the first 10 months of 2024, Cambodia harvested 840,000 tonnes of fresh cashew nuts, a 26% increase compared to the same period in 2023. Exports to Vietnam reached over 790,000 tonnes, a 31% increase, generating $111 million – a 9% year-on-year rise.

Silot noted that processed cashew exports in 2024 have declined compared to 2023, mainly due to two factors: the rise in fresh cashew nut prices on international markets and a lack of working capital for domestic processing enterprises, though exports are expected to increase in 2025.

He stated, "We are optimistic that the export of processed cashew nuts in 2025 will be higher than this year, as more international-standard cashew processing companies will start operating."

Loeng Kimsean, general manager of Loeng Manut Chamkarleu Cashew Nut Enterprise, mentioned that the price of fresh cashew in 2024 has risen compared to 2023, leading to an increase in exports to Vietnam. However, he said the processing capacity of domestic factories and industries remains limited.

He added that in the coming years, the export of fresh cashew nuts may slightly decrease as the number of processing factories and industries in the country continues to grow.

He concluded, "The processing capacity and the quality of Cambodia’s cashew nuts are gaining popularity in international markets. The export of processed cashew nuts will continue to grow."
