In a move that promises to reshape the way young Americans learn about Cambodian history, the Cambodian American Studies Model Curriculum (CASMC) has emerged as a pivotal tool for K-12 educators in California. 

This comprehensive curriculum, developed by the California Department of Education (CDE) in collaboration with community leaders and scholars, is designed to deepen students' understanding of the Cambodian American experience, from the traumatic history of the Cambodian genocide to the vibrant cultural contributions of today.

One of the most vocal supporters of the initiative is Sithea San, chair of Cambodia Town, a cultural hub in Long Beach, Los Angeles, which serves as a gathering point for the Cambodian American community. 

“For the younger generation, it creates an invaluable opportunity to learn about their parents' journeys from Cambodia to America, fostering a deeper understanding of their heritage and strengthening their cultural identity,” said San.

Under San’s leadership, Cambodia Town has worked tirelessly to preserve and promote Cambodian culture while empowering the local community through entrepreneurship, social services and educational initiatives.

In an exclusive interview with _The Post_, San discussed the significance of the CASMC, the impact it will have on younger generations, and her own organisation's role in supporting the curriculum’s creation and dissemination.

Like so many others, she fled the killing fields of the Khmer Rouge as a teenager and found refuge in Long Beach, where she attended college, got married and eventually bought a home.

**A curriculum to reflect the Cambodian-American experience**

The CASMC is a meticulously crafted resource aimed at educators who wish to teach about the history, culture, and contributions of Cambodian Americans. 

It includes primary sources, lesson strategies, planning resources and professional development tools designed to align with state standards while offering a comprehensive overview of Cambodian American heritage.

San explained that the curriculum provides an essential platform for telling the story of Cambodian Americans, many of whom, like her, are survivors of the Khmer Rouge regime that devastated Cambodia in the 1970s.

The curriculum not only focuses on the historical aspects of the Cambodian genocide but also integrates the personal experiences of survivors through oral testimonies. 

These firsthand accounts are critical in helping students understand the profound impact the genocide had on the Cambodian diaspora.

“The younger generation of Cambodian Americans will benefit tremendously from this curriculum,” San shared. 

**Cambodia Town’s role in supporting the curriculum**

While Cambodia Town itself was not the primary composer of the CASMC, San’s organisation played a crucial role in supporting its creation.

They hosted community input sessions, reviewed lesson materials and participated in leadership discussions to ensure the curriculum was culturally accurate and inclusive of the Cambodian American experience.

One of the significant contributions Cambodia Town made was assisting in the organisation of a two-day conference held by a public organisation, the Orange County Department of Education (OCDE), where educators were introduced to the curriculum. 

“We were honoured to be a part of the event, and we provided a unique, hands-on experience for educators by offering them a tour of Cambodia Town,” San explained. 

“This allowed them to immerse themselves in the culture, which will help them teach the material with more depth and understanding,” she added.

San’s organisation also played a role in promoting awareness of the curriculum and ensuring it reached the broader Cambodian American community. 

Her work highlights the importance of collaboration between community organisations, educators, and governmental bodies in creating educational resources that reflect the diverse histories of the US and its peoples.

**A Royal acknowledgment**

In recognition of Cambodia Town’s efforts in preserving and promoting Cambodian culture, the organisation recently received a letter of appreciation from His Majesty King Norodom Sihamoni of Cambodia. 

San expressed that this acknowledgment was both an honour and a source of motivation for the continued work ahead.

“It was a deeply humbling moment for all of us,” San said. “Cambodia Town has spent two decades fostering Khmer arts, culture and community development, and to receive such a prestigious recognition from the King is a testament to the importance of our mission. It encourages us to keep moving forward with our work.”

The royal recognition, San believes, will further bolster efforts to strengthen cultural ties between Cambodia and Cambodian American communities in the US. 

“It’s a reminder that our work is not just important to us here in America, but to those in Cambodia as well,” she noted. “It fuels our passion to expand our programs and continue advocating for the preservation of our heritage.”

**Strengthening cultural ties and identity**

The CASMC also serves as a tool for strengthening the cultural ties between Cambodia and the Cambodian American diaspora.

San believes the curriculum will provide Cambodian American students with a deeper understanding of their heritage and history, enabling them to build stronger connections with both their community and their ancestral homeland.

“By teaching young people about the achievements of the Khmer civilization – about the Angkor Empire, the great temples and the rich history – we empower them to take pride in their roots,” San explained. 

“The curriculum also creates opportunities for them to engage with their heritage in ways that many of them may not have had access to before.”

She emphasised that the curriculum is not just for Cambodian American students but for all students who wish to learn about the diverse histories that make up the fabric of American society. 

“The more we understand each other’s histories and cultures, the more united we become as a nation,” San said.

**Looking to the future**

San’s long-term vision for the Cambodian American Studies Model Curriculum extends beyond California. 

While the curriculum will initially be implemented in California public schools, San hopes to see it adopted by other states in the future. 

She envisions a nationwide effort to ensure that Cambodian American history is taught in classrooms across the country, helping to preserve the legacy of a community that has made significant contributions to American society.

“We’re committed to working with other Cambodian communities and educators to expand the reach of this curriculum,” San stated. 

“The goal is to ensure that every Cambodian American student has the opportunity to learn about their heritage, not just as a distant past but as an ongoing story that shapes their identity today.”

She said this curriculum provides a vital opportunity to share the story of why Cambodians came to the United States and highlights the rich legacy of the Khmer civilisation, which spans over 2,000 years. 

The Khmer people built great cities, important trading centres, and monumental temples throughout Thailand, Laos and Vietnam. 

“We urge young Cambodian Americans to take pride in their ancestors' achievements and embrace and preserve their heritage as a source of strength and inspiration for future generations,” San told _The Post_.
