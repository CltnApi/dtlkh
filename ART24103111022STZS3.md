Tourism minister Huot Hak leads a meeting to discuss tourism sector initiatives with representatives from the Korean Association in Cambodia, South Korean embassy officials and private-sector tourism partners on October 30. Tourism ministry

Minister of Tourism Huot Hak addressed representatives from the Korean Association in Cambodia, South Korean embassy officials and private-sector tourism partners regarding the country’s commitment to ensuring safety for tourists and investors.

The October 30 meeting followed a Korean TV report on alleged incidents involving Korean nationals detained or extorted in Cambodia, along with reports of online scams. Cambodian authorities have refuted these claims.

Hak emphasised the country’s high standards of security and order, fostering a welcoming environment for foreign investors and international tourists, particularly those from Korea.

“The Cambodian government is firmly committed to implementing stringent measures to combat all types of crime, both traditional and online,” he stressed during the meeting at the ministry headquarters.

Members of the association, along with embassy and private-sector representatives, shared their positive experiences travelling safely in Cambodia, encouraging the Korean community to visit the country confidently and without fear.

According to data from the ministry, the country received 132,286 Korean visitors from January to August, marking a 14.6 per cent increase from the same period in 2023. Korean tourists accounted for 3.1 per cent of the total 4.29 million international arrivals during that period.

A Korean-speaking tour guide based in Siem Reap told The Post that to further promote tourism, the ministry should make greater efforts to showcase the country’s tourist attractions. They said that more affordable access should be offered for Korean media producers, bloggers, coffee experts and well-known YouTubers to enhance promotion.

However, the guide expressed concerns that recent media coverage of alleged detentions or extortions involving Koreans could negatively affect Korean tourist sentiment.
