Clean Energy Week (CEW) 2024, Cambodia’s largest event focused on sustainable energy, concluded with a celebratory “Toast to Clean Energy” and the presentation of the Clean Energy Awards.

Now in its seventh year, CEW has become an essential platform for clean energy advocates, fostering dialogue and collaboration among policymakers, industry leaders, community representatives and international partners, according to a November 12 event press release.

Organised by EnergyLab Cambodia in partnership with the Ministry of Mines and Energy, CEW is supported by co-founders including the Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and the UN Development Programme (UNDP), along with contributions from the Cambodia Australia Partnership for Resilient Economic Development (CAPRED) and New Zealand’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade.

The release stated that throughout the week, the event highlighted the country’s advancements in renewable energy and its growing role as a leader in Southeast Asia’s clean energy transition. The occasion provided a space for discussing critical aspects of the energy shift, such as financing, energy storage, grid modernisation, and best practices in energy efficiency.

“CEW has shared the wide range of ways Cambodia can benefit from the shift to clean energy. Joint efforts and decisive actions are vital for opening up new jobs, increasing financial investments and improving the well-being of all Cambodian citizens,” said Natharoun Ngo Son, country director for EnergyLab.

According to the release, one of the event’s highlights was the Clean Energy Awards, which recognised key contributions from individuals, organisations and initiatives that are driving Cambodia’s progress. Notable awardees included Heineken Cambodia, which won for its biomass plant innovation in renewable technology; Bunly Ty, honoured for his work in sustainable community practices; and the Cambodia Clean Energy Competition, which was recognised for its impactful clean energy programme.

Australian ambassador to Cambodia Derek Yip praised the collaboration fostered by CEW.

“As a founding partner of CEW, Australia is proud to be supporting Cambodia’s energy sector. CEW is an important platform to celebrate Cambodia’s impressive progress and discuss the opportunities and challenges of the clean energy transition,” he was quoted as saying in the release.

Commenting on the event’s success, UNDP resident representative Alissar Chaker noted the importance of collaboration across sectors.

“Promoting clean energy is a collective responsibility, and UNDP reconfirms its commitment to work with its wide network of partners to support integrated policy, technology transfer and financial shifts that will build a net-zero, people-centred society,” she said.

According to the release, the event closed on an optimistic note, with participants acknowledging the country’s recently introduced national Electric Vehicle (EV) Charging Roadmap and other government initiatives aimed at supporting a sustainable and resilient future.

Since its inception in 2018, CEW is recognised as the country’s leading event dedicated to advancing clean energy solutions and fostering collaboration. It serves as a vital platform for knowledge sharing and policy development to drive the country’s clean energy transition, as per the release.
