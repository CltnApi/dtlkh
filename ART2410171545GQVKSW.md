# Foreign Ministry says Anwar unaware of Cambodian opposition figure’s entry

The Foreign Ministry confirmed that ex-Cambodian opposition leader Sam Rainsy has left Malaysia Wednesday morning (May 31).

Wisma Putra, in a statement last night, said no public programme was held during Rainsy’s stay here.

“With regard to the presence of the former Chief Opposition Member of Cambodia Sam Rainsy in Malaysia, the Foreign Ministry wishes to reiterate that Prime Minister Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim was not informed of his arrival to this country.”
