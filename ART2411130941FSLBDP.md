As the eagerly anticipated Bon Om Touk – or Water Festival – commences, Phnom Penh has come alive with vibrant displays of traditional Khmer art.

The centrepiece of this year’s celebrations features impressive illuminated archways installed at three locations in the capital, crafted with intricate carvings that showcase the country’s cultural heritage. 

In contrast to previous years, when festival banners were simply printed, this year’s decorations are carved, infusing an elevated sense of artistry and tradition into the event.

The archway’s golden tones and detailed carvings bring life to patterns from ancient Khmer architecture, interweaving symbols and motifs deeply rooted in Cambodian history. 

Prominent Khmer-script banners at the top of the archways welcome both locals and visitors to the festive season, while carvings of boats and figures honour the iconic boat races, a hallmark of the holiday. 

This year’s archways, framed by traditional pillars and vibrant colours, embody unity, celebration and reverence for Cambodia’s rivers, which hold a vital place in both the festival and the nation’s life.

Nak Nang, the artist entrusted with carving the banners and archways, expressed pride in his team’s work for the 2024 festival. 

“This is my first time leading the project, and it feels more significant than in previous years,” shared Nang.

Together, their teams are responsible for setting up the archways at three main locations: Preah Sisowath Quay near Wat Unnalom, Wat Phnom and Independence Monument.

"In past festivals, the decorations were printed onto hardboard, but this year, carved signs have been introduced for the first time," Nang told _The Post_. 

Phnom Penh Municipal Hall decided on the carvings at short notice, requiring the team to work around the clock to complete both the carving and installation.

Despite the limited preparation time, the team, comprising over 20 volunteer sculptors, has been tirelessly working around the clock. 

Nang’s group has already completed installation at Preah Sisowath Quay and is expected to finish at the other locations just before the festival begins.

San, a celebrated designer and expert in Khmer art, shared insights into the creative process for this year’s mural designs. 

He said the National Committee for Organising National and International Festivals wanted a standout event this year.

Known for designing the Prey Veng Songkran archway, San said, “This design was based on my own concept, drawing from my many years of experience, with adjustments made by Phnom Penh’s deputy governor.”

“I based the designs on motifs from the Angkor period, a golden era of Cambodian history, which Phnom Penh’s deputy governor helped adjust for this year’s festival,” he told _The Post_. 

With just a week to construct and install the decorations, San expressed his gratitude for Nang’s dedicated team, emphasising their role in bringing the ambitious designs to life.

Nang, who is highly regarded for his expertise in 3D artwork and Khmer calligraphy, hails from Pao commune in Kampong Cham province.

He also offers free art education to orphans at a pagoda in his hometown, teaching groups of 20 to 30 children each weekend, sharing his skills and passion for Cambodian art with the next generation.

During the 2018 Sangkran (Khmer New Year) celebration, San captured the public's attention with his design of an archway in Prey Veng province, featuring large rice bunches and two angels. 

This year’s carved and floodlit displays at the festival, which runs from November 14-16, stand as a testament to Cambodia’s rich artistic heritage, inviting visitors to join in this vibrant celebration and experience the unity, beauty and tradition of Bon Om Touk.
