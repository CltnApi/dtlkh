Battambang-based artist Hour Seyha is inviting the capital’s art enthusiasts to embark on a mystical adventure through his new solo exhibition, “_Dream Odyssey_”. 

Open to the public for free until November 18, visitors can explore Seyha's latest works at the FT Gallery at Factory Phnom Penh from 10am to 6pm daily.

This exhibition represents a new chapter in Seyha's artistic narrative, following his previous visual fables, including _Frog in the Well_ (2014), _Welcome to My Feudal Village_ (2016) and _That Which is Hidden_ (2019). 

Known for depicting the struggles of Khmer society through mystical scenes influenced by his personal experiences, Seyha is now attempting to explore the dreamlike realms of the subconscious.

“_Dream Odyssey_” presents the tale of a young Khmer peasant whose life is irrevocably altered by a catastrophic event. 

“Thrust into a cosmic journey, he traverses surreal landscapes filled with mystical beings and chaotic environments,” explains Seyha.

“Upon returning to his devastated village, the protagonist undergoes a meditative awakening, transforming into a guardian angel in the form of a dragonfly – tasked with protecting a couple destined to restore a prosperous Khmer nation,” he says.

Through this series, the artist expresses his fascination with interstellar travel and natural disasters, while voicing his concerns for the future of Cambodia and the planet. 

By inviting viewers to navigate both his nightmares and his dreams, he challenges them to interpret the strange scenes and rich symbolism that characterise his work. 

The exhibition features 27 distinct canvases, each splashed with his unique style and textured expressions.

Born in Oddar Meanchey province in 1991, Seyha graduated from the Phare Ponleu Selpak Visual Arts School in 2013. 

He current produce’s his work at Battambang’s Romcheik 5 Art Space. His artistic journey has been marked by personal hardships, including themes of abandonment and exile during his childhood – experiences that frequently resonate in his art.

Aside from numerous individual and group shows, he has also been shown internationally, as part of _From Cambodia_ (2012) in Toronto, Canada, and _Saison du Cambodge_ (2018) in Paris, France.

As audiences immerse themselves in this enchanting exhibition, they are invited to contemplate the depths of their own dreams and the stories that shape their realities.
