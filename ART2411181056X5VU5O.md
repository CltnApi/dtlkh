The streets and galleries of Phnom Penh will come alive with artistic energy as the 15th Photo Phnom Penh Festival (PPP) takes centre stage from November 21 to December 21. 

This year’s festival is a special milestone, celebrating fifteen years of artistic innovation and cross-cultural dialogue.

This year, 60 artists will showcase their artworks at various exhibitions and venues.

Founded in 2008 on the initiative of Alain Arnaudet, then director of the French Cultural Center (now the French Institute of Cambodia), the PPP has become a vibrant platform where global and local photographic talents converge, offering a lens into diverse worlds.

“This edition is a celebration of how far we’ve come,” said Christian Caujolle, Co-founder and artistic director of the festival.

“When we began, Cambodian photography was almost nonexistent in the contemporary scene. Today, it’s flourishing, with new voices contributing to a global dialogue on identity, history, and art,” he says.

With over 60 exhibitions, screenings, and community-focused events, this year’s festival is a sensory journey for enthusiasts and newcomers alike.

The French Institute’s gallery serves as the festival’s heartbeat, hosting Welcome Back: 60 Perspectives, a showcase of works by 60 photographers who have previously exhibited at the PPP. This collection offers an eclectic mix of styles, ranging from documentary realism to conceptual art.

“The diversity of these works reflects the essence of the festival,” says Caujolle. “They remind us that photography is not just a medium; it’s a language of emotions and ideas.”

One standout is Vincent Fournier’s Post Natural History, displayed on the wall of the French Embassy in Phnom Penh.

Fournier’s hybrid creations – a fusion of science, nature and imagination – challenge viewers to rethink evolution. 

“Photography allows me to visualise a future that balances nostalgia with possibility,” explains Fournier.

Local talent shines equally brightly. At the Bophana Center, Sovanna Ly presents Ranoch Visited Angkor, a poignant black-and-white series imagining a visit to Angkor Wat that Ly’s late mother had dreamed of. 

“These photographs are not just images but a fulfilment of a promise made to someone who is no longer here,” notes Ly, emphasising the emotional depth of his work.

Meanwhile, Sovanna Kem’s Landscape Sculpted by Light, to be displayed at Phnom Penh International Airport, transforms Cambodia’s landscapes into ethereal paintings. “Light is my muse,” says Kem, whose work reimagines familiar scenes through meticulous timing and framing.

The festival goes beyond the visual, integrating other mediums to tell powerful stories. 

Screenings of short films, including RothaMoeung’sThe Rubber Tappers, explore societal and environmental issues. Set in Cambodia’s rubber plantations, Moeung’s film is a tender yet critical look at the lives of one of the Kingdom’s marginalised communities.

Another highlight is Indian filmmaker and Magnum photographer Sohrab Hura’s The Coast, which captures Tamil Nadu’s coastal scenes. 

“My work questions how we relate to the natural world,” Hura shares. “It’s about finding new ways to interpret old landscapes.”

The screenings are complemented by engaging discussions, such as the roundtable Bridging Cultures: Women in Photography, featuring artists like Sophal Neak, Sereyrath Mech and France’s Aglaé Bory. 

“This dialogue is vital,” says Bory. “It’s through these exchanges that we redefine narratives and expand artistic boundaries.”

PPP is as much about community as it is about art. The TukTuk Tours offer an interactive way to explore the festival, guiding attendees through outdoor and indoor exhibitions across nine key venues, including the French Institute, Bophana Center and Factory Phnom Penh. 

“Art should be accessible to everyone,” adds Caujolle. “The tours bring the city’s vibrant culture and creativity to life.”

Another community-driven initiative is Photo is Your Memory, a free service where festival-goers can scan, restore and print their old photographs. 

“This project ensures that personal and cultural histories are preserved,” explains Caujolle. “It’s about keeping memories alive for future generations.”

A cornerstone of this year’s festival is the launch of Studio Images, Cambodia’s dedicated photography training centre.

Supported by the Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation, the centre is poised to become a hub for nurturing local talent and fostering international collaborations.

Artists like Sayon Soun, known for his haunting black-and-white portraits of urban workers, exemplify this evolution. 

Soun’s exhibit, Black and White, to be displayed at Studio Images, captures the soul of Cambodia’s urban life through striking contrasts of light and shadow. 

The festival’s 15th edition places a special emphasis on France as a partner nation, a nod to the French Institute’s enduring support since the festival’s inception. 

French photographers like Alexandre Bergamini and Bory bring unique perspectives, blending personal narratives with broader cultural themes.

Bergamini’s Hiroshima, The Return to Life, exhibited at Factory Phnom Penh, is a meditative exploration of memory and absence, while Bory’s post-Covid-19 portraits of French youth highlight resilience and renewal. 

“Photography is about capturing the intangible,” says Bergamini. “It’s a way of holding onto what we can’t touch.”

As the festival celebrates its past, it also looks to the future. The integration of video and multimedia elements reflects photography’s evolving role in storytelling. 

“This year, we’re seeing more animated images and experimental formats,” adds Caujolle. “It’s exciting to witness the boundaries of photography being pushed.”

The festival’s commitment to environmental issues is also evident. Sereyrath Mech’s When the Sun Reaches the River uses infrared photography to document the environmental and social impact of Cambodia’s Lower Se San II dam. 

“Art has the power to make us see what we might otherwise ignore,” explains Mech.

From the evocative works of local artists to the thought-provoking contributions of international talents, this year’s festival will be a reminder of photography’s universal language.

For anyone in Phnom Penh or beyond, the festival is an unmissable journey through the diverse landscapes of contemporary photography.
