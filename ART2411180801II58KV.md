Over 80 companies from Cambodia and the UK are participating in the 2024 Cambodia International Trade Exhibition, an event aimed at supporting the country’s women-owned businesses and strengthening trade relations between the two kingdoms.

The event is organised by the Cambodia Women Entrepreneurs’ Network (CamWEN) with support from ITC SheTrades and UK International Development. It will take place from November 18-19 at the Koh Pich Convention and Exhibition Centre. Following the expo, a series of business-to-business engagements for women entrepreneurs will be held in Jakarta, Indonesia later in the week.

According to the event's promotional materials, the country’s women-led businesses will have the opportunity to engage directly with UK delegates. On the second day, UK companies will visit women’s businesses in the garments, footwear and travel goods (GFT) and handicraft sectors across Phnom Penh and surrounding areas, offering further opportunities for business discussions.

Minister of Commerce Cham Nimul stated during the opening ceremony that the event aims to promote the export of Cambodian-made GFT products to the UK. She noted that the exhibition allows Cambodian companies and enterprises to showcase their products and meet directly with key buyers from the UK.

She emphasised that the GFT industries are priority sectors that significantly contribute to the development of the country’s economy and society.

The minister also highlighted the strong and growing relationship between Cambodia and the UK across all sectors, particularly in trade and investment.

She remarked, “This event has been organised at an opportune time as part of our efforts to strengthen trade participation and relations between the two countries. It will provide a platform for our private sector to engage in discussions and explore opportunities for trade agreements, especially in exporting textiles, clothing and footwear to the UK, contributing to the growth of bilateral trade.”

The General Department of Customs and Excise (GDCE) reported that from January to October this year, trade between the two countries totalled $850.74 million, marking a 15.7% increase compared to the same period in 2023. 

Exports to the UK reached approximately $807 million, a 21.1% year-on-year increase, while imports from the UK were $43.38 million, a decrease of 36.7%.

Eng Lykuong, chair of the ASEAN Women Entrepreneurs Network (AWEN) and president of CamWEN, highlighted that the exhibition highlights the country’s commitment to global participation. 

She said the event showcases high-quality products with creative designs and exquisite craftsmanship, reflecting the country’s ability to attract international markets and increase exports.

Lykuong emphasised that the success of the event is due to significant contributions by the government in fostering a favourable environment for international trade.

She stated, "Cambodia has abundant resources, including skilled labour, competitive production costs and a rich tradition of craftsmanship. These factors contribute to the creation of high-quality products meeting international standards while preserving the essence of Cambodia’s cultural heritage.”

British ambassador to Cambodia Dominic Williams remarked, “It’s fantastic to speak up in support of gender equality, and I encourage everyone to do so.”

He said, “It’s even better to go one step further and offer practical support to women doing amazing things in all walks of life. So, we are delighted that the British embassy is doing just that – offering amazing women-led small and medium-sized enterprises \[SMEs\] a platform to showcase their products to commercial buyers, who have flown out especially from the UK to source Cambodian products to sell back home.”

“I hope this trade mission helps women-led businesses to increase their revenues and grow, leading to more UK consumers having the opportunity to purchase wonderful Cambodian products,” he added.
