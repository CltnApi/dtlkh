Payments through Malaysia’s live QR links with Thailand, Indonesia and Singapore booming.

Bank Negara Malaysia (BNM) and the National Bank of Cambodia (NBC) have launched a cross-border QR payment system which allows consumers and merchants in both countries to make and receive instant cross-border payments.

Malaysia and Cambodia are already reported to be leading the growth in QR transactions among the 10 members of the Association of Southeast Asia Nations (Asean).

In a joint statement released in Phnom Penh, the central banks say that September 19 marked the end of the first phase of the project to develop the system under a memorandum of understanding signed during a visit to Malaysia by Prime Minister Hun Manet in February.
