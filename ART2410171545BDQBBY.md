# ‘More than a tent, less than a palace’: The house that Andy Goh built

He has been involved in some of the region’s grandest projects, but this hospitality group founder and CEO is trading it all for a simpler – but no less luxurious – life.

There are chickens cackling in the background when we call Andy Goh. It’s not the usual soundtrack to our interviews with C-suite executives – but, as we come to learn during our conversations with Goh, he isn’t someone to take a well-pecked path.

The 49-year-old is CEO of investment holding firm Jonah Journeys and the founder of R+, a hospitality brand focused on responsible luxury. For most of his career, though, Goh was CEO for emerging markets at Ong&Ong, one of Singapore’s largest architectural and urban planning firms.

An architect by training, he has been credited with introducing “super architecture” to Cambodia and Myanmar, and has overseen more than a few lofty projects in the region, including the Architecture MasterPrize-winning Bishopsgate House, and the sprawling Alma Resort in Vietnam’s Nha Trang, a waterfront property with 580 suites, 12 swimming pools that cascade into the ocean, and even its own science museum.
