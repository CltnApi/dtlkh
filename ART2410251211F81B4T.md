Prime Minister Hun Manet has urged the public to remain vigilant of the dangers of online and cyber scams, to avoid falling victim to them. He also directed the authorities to prevent these crimes, noting that criminals target individuals indiscriminately, even high-profile figures like himself.

“Scammers are trying to use Telegram to lure people into purchasing various things. Someone even used my friend’s name to ask for $500 from me, claiming he was stuck in Italy after their bag was stolen. They asked me to transfer the $500 as quickly as possible. I asked my friend, ‘How did you get stuck in Italy?’ and they replied, ‘I haven’t even left Cambodia’,” he said, while addressing the inauguration ceremony of a multi-sector dam in Mondulkiri Province on October 24.

“We must be very cautious with this new technology. The authorities – including the Ministry of Interior, Ministry of Post and Telecommunications, and other specialised institutions – are all working on this issue. We need to be extremely careful. Technology is complex, so we must be cautious when using it. I ask our security forces, especially specialists, to curb online scams as much as possible,” he added.

Cyber scams, or online scams, come in many forms. This includes impersonating relatives or friends who are supposedly in financial trouble, the sale of fake products, charity scams and data theft. Larger-scale scams include fake recruitment schemes, which sometimes force victims to become perpetrators of online crimes themselves, as well as fraudulent investments.

According to the Global Anti-Scam Alliance (GASA), online crime is rising worldwide. Last year alone, over $1 trillion was lost globally due to scams.

The GASA’s latest Asia Scam Report 2024 found that out of 24,731 people surveyed across 13 countries (excluding Cambodia) in 2024, approximately $688.42 billion was lost to online scams.

The report noted that the fast nature of money transfers complicates prevention, as this speed allows criminals to exploit the system and leaves senders unable to retrieve their funds.

GASA advisors emphasised that beyond law enforcement, education is essential. Increasing public awareness about criminal tactics and encouraging reporting of suspicious activity to the authorities is crucial.

In Cambodia, some foreign embassies have previously issued warnings to their citizens about fake recruitment schemes that could lead to them becoming forced to work in online scam centres. Analysts have pointed out that Cambodian authorities need to address this issue, as it has a detrimental effect on the Kingdom’s reputation.

Pa Chanroeun, executive director of the Cambodian Institute for Democracy, warned that “This issue seriously affects Cambodia’s reputation in the international arena, particularly regarding investment, tourism and international relations.”

He added that the situation has grown and become a regional issue, impacting various countries, both where the crimes occur and where victims reside, and must be addressed collectively and transparently.

“Cambodia must tackle this issue, clear up suspicions and restore the damage that online scams and cybercrimes have done to its reputation,” he said.
