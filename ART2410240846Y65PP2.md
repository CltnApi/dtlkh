During her historic visit to Cambodia, Samantha Power, administrator for the US Agency for International Development (USAID), announced an additional $5 million in support for civil society, workers and independent media. 

Power is the first USAID administrator to visit Cambodia, and during her remarks in Phnom Penh on Wednesday, October 23 she emphasised the significance of upholding democratic values, particularly the freedom of the press.

In a speech that touched on the US commitment to transparency and human rights, she acknowledged the case of journalist Mech Dara, who was arrested and now released on bail after spending more than 20 days in Kandal Provincial Prison. 

“I had a chance to both meet with Dara's family and to raise this issue, along with other concerning cases, in my meeting with the prime minister today \[October 23\],” Power said during her press conference.  

"Productive meeting with \[Prime Minister Hun Manet\] about the deepening of the US-Cambodia relationship,” the US embassy in Phnom Penh quoted Power. 

“We discussed our work together in areas like health and education, and the importance of making progress on critical issues like labour rights, civil society and anti-corruption,” she said.

She stressed the sensitivity of the situation but reiterated, "I will just underscore that we have emphasised our support for finding positive resolutions."

Mech Dara, a freelancer journalist in Cambodia, was detained and accused of inciting to cause serious social unrest. 

He was freed this morning, October 24, after apologising to Senate president Hun Sen and the prime minister for his mistake in posting fake news on social media.

In the video, Dara, wearing prison attire, admitted that prior to his arrest, he had posted inaccurate information along with photos of Ba Phnom Mountain in Prey Veng province on social media in September.

"All the messages I posted were false information that offended the leaders and the country. I am deeply sorry and apologise for any inaccuracies I have shared," he stated in the video. "I promise to stop posting information that harms the leaders and the nation."

Power emphasised that the US wants to be a strong partner in Cambodia’s economic growth, but this can only be realised if human rights and transparency are prioritised.

“Working toward greater transparency, accountability and protection of human rights can unlock extraordinary prosperity for the Cambodian people,” she stated. “That can be the promise of a new generation.”

While press freedom was a key theme of Power’s speeches, she also addressed broader US-Cambodia relations, highlighting the potential for economic growth if the country can improve its legal and business environment. 

Power shared that American companies are eager to invest in Cambodia but are concerned about corruption, labour rights and the country’s international reputation, particularly due to issues like cybercrime.

She said that for investment to occur, there must be meaningful improvements in the business environment, specifically addressing these issues.

“It’s really important for investors to have confidence in the rule of law and to know that they can invest here without paying bribes or engaging in illegal kickbacks,” said Power. 

“There is great potential for the relationship between the US and Cambodia to grow stronger,” Power said, “but as is the case in all of our important relationships, there are also concerns, including unjustified arrests and threats to basic rights.”
