The policy-making body of the Mekong River Commission (MRC) has elected a new chief executive. Busadee Santipitaks of Thailand, who will serve from 2025 to 2027, is the first woman elected to the role.

She will succeed Anoulak Kittikhoun of Laos, whose leadership was widely praised during the meeting.

During the November 27 meeting, held in Luang Prabang, Laos, the MRC Council also reviewed progress, addressed the growing challenges facing the Mekong River Basin and re-committed to regional cooperation. 

According to a November 28 MRC press release, the members stressed the urgency of continued collaboration to ensure a sustainable future for Southeast Asia’s largest waterway, particularly amid the increasing pressures of climate change, development and transboundary impacts.

“The Mekong River Basin faces increasing challenges from climate change and development pressures. We must unite in our efforts to safeguard the river that sustains the livelihoods of millions,” said Bounkham Vorachit, 2024 council chair.

The council lauded the expansion of the Core River Monitoring Network and enhanced forecasting, along with an agreement on the application of the transboundary EIA Guidelines, as excellent accomplishments from 2024.

The members also reiterated the need for collective action, particularly due to the growing urgency of addressing regional challenges.

“Our ability to build stronger partnerships, deepen connectivity, and enhance cooperation will determine our success in safeguarding the Mekong as a source of life and prosperity for generations to come,” explained Thor Chetha, Cambodian Minister of Water Resources and Meteorology.

Several MRC development partners also praised the commission’s progress in 2024, especially in terms of data sharing, emergency response coordination, international partnerships and stakeholder engagement.

In a joint statement, they underscored the importance of continued transparency and cooperation in managing the Basin’s water resources and addressing the impacts of climate change. 

“Climate change and development pressures are straining the Basin’s ecosystem. The MRC plays an increasingly critical role in promoting and coordinating sustainable management and development of water and related resources for the countries’ mutual benefit and the people’s well-being,” said Christina Laun, head of division, for Germany’s BMZ.

According to the release, the Council also approved the 2025–2026 Multi-Year Work Plan, which will contribute to the implementation of the Basin Development Strategy, strengthen climate resilience and improve water resource management across the region. 

“As the MRC moves into the final year of its current Strategic Plan (2021–2025), the Council’s message is clear: the Mekong River requires urgent protection. With continued collaboration, enhanced data sharing and a commitment to sustainability, the MRC will lead efforts to ensure the future of the Mekong River Basin for generations to come,” it concluded.
