ABC Stout proudly announces the launch of its latest innovation, ABC Smooth stout, with a grand unveiling that captivated the city with a vibrant flash mob at three prominent locations in Phnom Penh.

The event took an unexpected turn when a flash mob erupted, thrilling onlookers with a spontaneous dance performance that culminated in the dramatic unveiling of billboards draped in golden silk cloth. As golden confetti burst into the air, the new ABC Smooth was revealed, leaving the crowd in awe.

ABC, long recognised as the premium choice among Cambodian stout enthusiasts, continues its tradition of excellence with the newly launched ABC Smooth. This 5.3% ABV stout is less bitter, delivering a truly smooth drinking experience while maintaining the unique bittersweet flavour that stouts are known for.

An Sokha, a local resident who witnessed the vibrant flash mob during the unveiling, shared, “It was a complete surprise! I happened to pass by and suddenly saw a throng of people start dancing simultaneously, followed by the beautiful unveiling of the unique, eye-catching billboards. As the performance grew, so did the excitement.”

Bunthea, who was at Takhmao Market, witnessed the flash mob in Kandal. He shared his excitement, describing the moment when the dancers began their performance just as the golden cloth was pulled back from the billboard and confetti was released, calling it “spectacular.” A loyal fan of ABC, he noted, “I’ve always enjoyed ABC’s bold, distinctive taste, and now with this smooth and light version, I’m excited to try it.”

Willem van den Wijngaart, Heineken Cambodia’s marketing director, expressed his pride in the brand’s legacy: “ABC holds a special place in our hearts. To be Cambodia’s number one stout for three decades speaks to people’s love for the taste of real stout. ABC Smooth was crafted to honour this legacy – brewed longer with the finest roasted malts for a perfectly balanced, less bitter taste that’s smooth and easy to drink. It offers a unique experience, distinct from black lager, with the body, aroma, and depth of a real stout.”

Packaged in a striking gold can, ABC Smooth’s iconic packaging reflects its premium positioning and appeals to consumers who appreciate standing out from the crowd. The distinctive golden packaging symbolises the premium quality and smooth excellence of ABC Smooth.

Starting this month, ABC Smooth will be available nationwide across Cambodia in supermarkets, convenience stores, drink shops, restaurants, pubs, hotels and entertainment outlets. Consumers across Cambodia are invited to experience the real smooth stout – ABC Smooth.
