The launch of _**The Perfect Motion**_ – or _**Tep Hattha**_ in Khmer – an educational guidebook, alongside the completion of phase one of the Youth Empowerment Project, marked a significant moment in Cambodia's educational landscape today, November 5.

The initiatives aim to empower Cambodian youth through vocational training, cultural appreciation and civic engagement, reaching students across numerous provinces.

The first part of the event was dedicated to the release of the Khmer-language adaptation of the guidebook which accompanies the critically acclaimed documentary by French director Xavier de Lauzanne. The film chronicles the journey and cultural significance of the Royal Ballet of Cambodia.

Originally produced in French by the Lycée français René Descartes, the guidebook was adapted by Sipar to support Cambodian schools in teaching students about the country's artistic heritage.

Minister of Education, Youth and Sport Hang Chuon Naron thanked the filmmaker for creating the documentary, which supports Cambodian cultural promotion and provides resources for youth research and training, particularly focusing on the Royal Ballet.

“I extend my appreciation to the French government, the French Development Agency \[AFD\], Sipar, our development partners and all relevant professional bodies for their commitment to educational reform, particularly youth development, to deliver quality, equitable education and lifelong learning opportunities for all,” said Chuon Naron.

The film presents an intimate look at the country’s Royal Ballet, tracing its resilience and evolution since 1906.

It weaves together the creation of the ballet _**Metamorphosis**_ by Princess Norodom Buppha Devi and the broader history of the ballet, touching on its near loss during the Khmer Rouge era and subsequent revival.

Featuring personal stories from young dancers and experienced ballet masters, the documentary is both a cultural tribute and a resource for educators.

Lach Rachna, an official from French NGO Sipar, noted that the guidebook was developed to complement educational screenings of the film.

Through this guide, Cambodian educators can foster classroom discussions and help students connect with the country’s rich traditions.

“Students aren’t just watching for entertainment; they’re encouraged to discuss the themes covered in the movie,” she explained. “This guide is aimed at teachers who wish to explore the film's topics further with their students.”

Speaking to school principals and provincial representatives from the education department, Rachna added, through insights from the film and the exercises in this book, teachers can help students engage in discussions and develop their critical thinking skills regarding the film's content.

Siem Reap provincial education department deputy director Nhek Sokun, a member of the workshop, said the book is incredibly valuable in providing knowledge to both teachers and students.

“If there is more training, it will be even better, as this will deepen \[students’\] understanding of Cambodia’s national cultural heritage,” he said.

Earlier this year, the Overseas Cambodian Investment Corporation (OCIC Group) partnered with Aloest Productions to expand the documentary’s reach across Europe.

Beginning in early 2024, the film has been screened in over 30 cities, introducing Cambodian cultural history to international audiences and the Khmer diaspora.

Dance instructor Sok Sitha, from Princess Norodom Buppha Devi Dance School, noted that the school provides free instruction in traditional Khmer dances to over 200 students, helping preserve the country’s cultural heritage.

“We teach various traditional dances, including the _**Sampeah**_, or Khmer-style salute, rooted in classical Khmer dance,” Sitha explained.

De Lauzanne said the value of art is its universality.

“_**The Perfect Motion**_ is not only about Cambodia, but also about the essential link between the identity of people and artistic creativity,” he added.

“Sok Nalys, one of the young dancers in the film, said ‘When culture withers the nation crumbles away. When culture flourishes the nation thrives.’ The ballet helped to restore the dignity of Cambodia after the cruelty and deprivation of the Khmer Rouge era. This film pays tribute to all who had a part in the return of culture and light,” he continued.

In order to reach the widest audience, de Lauzanne explained that the film has been dubbed into Khmer.

Rising to fame as a prima ballerina and later enduring life in a refugee camp near the Thai border, Voan Savay, one of the masters featured in the documentary, carried the legacy of Khmer classical dance.

Traumatised after the Khmer Rouge, she initially sought to flee abroad but changed her mind at the border, choosing instead to stay, gather children and teach them the art of dance.

“I can die and be reborn, but the art form cannot die,” she added.

**Phase two of the youth empowerment project**  

The seminar reflected on the successes of the first phase of the Youth Empowerment Project, which was co-funded by AFD and developed by Sipar in collaboration with the Ministry of Education, Youth and Sport. 

The three-year initiative (October 2021-September 2024) supported over 27,000 students across 16 secondary schools in 14 provinces. 

The project provided modernised library services, reading resources, vocational training, digital skills programmes and civic engagement opportunities.

As phase one concluded, Sipar celebrated the development of 11 book titles and four digital content types designed to enhance vocational skills and civic awareness. 

Sipar general director Hok Sothy expressed gratitude for the ministry’s and AFD’s support as the organisation moves into the second phase. 

Covering 24 provinces, phase two will engage over 40,000 young people, including around 20,000 women, across high schools, youth centres and community groups.

“Phase two will strengthen youth vocational training and community engagement over the next 32 months,” Sothy shared.

Sokun also discussed the programme’s local impact, mentioning that 28 Makara High School in Siem Reap’s Srei Snam district joined the second phase. 

“Through this expansion, more students and teachers will benefit from vocational training and cultural education, helping them appreciate and preserve Cambodia’s heritage,” he added.

The project’s second phase, running from October 2024 to May 2027, will focus on expanding training, volunteerism and civic engagement. 

With a budget of over $980,000, of which AFD funds 80 per cent and Sipar 20 per cent, the initiative aligns with the country’s national youth development policy.

During his address, Chuon Naron explained that phase two’s outreach will target young people between the ages of 12 and 25, emphasising the involvement of young women. 

“This project will further support Cambodia’s educational reform, focusing on equitable, quality education and lifelong learning opportunities for all,” he said.

French ambassador to Cambodia Jacques Pellet expressed hope for books to retain their influence in society.

“Culture holds significant value in Cambodia, especially for young people,” he remarked. “AFD has supported Sipar for over a decade due to its important role in cultural and educational development, particularly in fostering reading culture in Cambodia.”
