# New initiative offers new hope in search for relatives lost to Khmer Rouge

Last September, in a heartfelt announcement during the Cambodian Film Festival in Long Beach, California, Li-Da Kruger, a Cambodian-British filmmaker, revealed a groundbreaking project aimed at reuniting some of the countless families that were brutally separated under the Khmer Rouge regime.

Kruger, whose own story of adoption and search for her roots is captured in the documentary _Prue Leith: Journey with My Daughter_, introduced the initiative, which offers free DNA testing to help Cambodian’s rediscover long-lost relatives.

DNA testing was offered as part of a special event at the Art Theatre in Long Beach, and coincided with the screening of her documentary.

Kruger, who was adopted as a baby by British TV personality Prue Leith and her late husband Rayne Kruger just before the Khmer Rouge regime took control, shared her personal story of searching for her biological family through DNA testing.

This journey inspired her to launch DNACambodia, a project which uses DNA technology to reunite families torn apart by war, genocide, and poverty.

Attendees of the screening had the chance to meet some of her own relatives, who turned out to be living in Long Beach, and who were identified thanks to DNA testing.

“We offer free DNA testing, and hope you will join my charity project to help reunite Cambodian families,” said Kruger. 

The film explores Li-Da’s roots, as she searches for her biological family amidst the devastation caused by the Khmer Rouge regime. Her story has since inspired many others to seek their lost relatives.

Through Kruger's nonprofit organisation, Reconnecting Cambodia, in collaboration with the Khmer Family Charity Organization (KFCO), free DNA testing has become a beacon of hope for Cambodians searching for family members lost during the darkest period in the country's history.

“Every test taken brings us one step closer to reuniting families and finding peace," she said, as she encouraged anyone with missing family members to come forward.

The impact of the initiative may be profound, especially for those who have been living with unanswered questions for decades. 

Many, like Li-Da, believed their loved ones had perished, only to discover through DNA tests that some have survived.

Charles Song, currently residing in the US, is now searching for his relatives in Cambodia, thanks to the project.

Before the fall of Cambodia in 1975, thousands of children were airlifted out of the war-torn country by the International Orphanage Agency. 

While some of these children found new homes through adoption, many were placed in foster care, scattered across the globe. 

For many, decades have passed without legal naturalisation, and the fate of their biological families remains unknown.

According to a 2015 report, countless individuals remain separated from their families. Some have been fortunate enough to reconnect after more than 40 years, but the heartbreaking reality is that thousands, including Charles Song’s eldest brother, are still missing.

“While it's assumed many of our long-lost family members may have perished, we still hold onto hope that one day we will reunite with them,” Song shared, in a recent plea for support.

Song, along with many other Cambodian refugees, has now taken the free DNA test provided by DNACambodia. 

“I am proud to join Li-Da and many others in this mission. This simple, two-minute test offers a chance for those of us who have been separated from our families to finally find answers,” he said.

Song encouraged others with missing family members to participate.

“Every test helps someone searching for their loved ones, even if you're not actively looking for yourself. We have nothing to lose and everything to gain,” he explained.

He urged anyone with questions or interest in the programme to reach out to him directly.

"Please help us circulate this message as widely as possible. Every test counts and could bring a family back together,” Song added.

Li-Da echoed his sentiments, urging anyone with missing family members to participate in the free DNA testing. 

This project, which offers renewed hope to the victims and their families, has touched many, with viewers of the documentary praising it as an overwhelming and emotional experience.​
