The Queen Mother Library, a treasure trove of Cambodia’s most important historical books and documents, provides a place for students to not only conduct research, but to learn to understand their own Khmer identity.

Ros Sampoeu, manager of the library, told _The Post_ that the library was established by the Documentation Center of Cambodia (DC-Cam) in 2020 to honour Queen Mother Norodom Monineath Sihanouk, who worked tirelessly to support King Norodom Sihanouk in his fight for the liberation and independence of Cambodia.

The facility is a repository of two main types of documents: 1. Those related to the reign of King Norodom Sihanouk from the 1950s to the 1970s and documents related to the Democratic Kampuchea regime (1975-1979); and 2. Human rights documents related to international relations between Cambodia and its allies from 1979 until the present day.

“We divide our primary collection into five types: Physical documents, evidentiary documents, survivor testimonies such as audio recordings, photographs and film footage,” explained Sampoeun.

“Additionally, we have many other documents related to art, culture and the law, in English, French and Khmer,” he added.

The library is open from 7.30am to 12.00pm and from 1.30pm to 5.00pm, Monday through Friday. Students and other members of the public can visit in person or send a message in advance to the library team via their Facebook page.

“We welcome the public to join freely. They can sign up for internships, read books, do research, take photos as souvenirs or make videos for YouTube. In the past, many young couples have come to take pre-wedding photos, and researchers often request documents. We have digital documents scanned into PDF files, which we can send to them,” said the manager.

“We have welcomed thousands of foreign students who want to learn about the Queen Mother Library and study Cambodian history. They appreciate our organisation because our team is skilled in writing, researching theses, and locating supporting documents, especially regarding Khmer history,” he added.

Ros Sampoeu shared his personal story, and reflected on the importance of maintaining a database of the Kingdom’s complex history. 

“On April 17, 1975, I was just 11 years old. My father, Rous Somanarak, was a government official, and my mother, Chim Thong, was a gem trader. Our family lived near De Po Market,” he said.

He recalled the impact of the new regime, and the sudden horrified realisations of many citizens, who had not realised the depths that Pol Pot’s depraved philosophy would drag the Kingdom down to.

“That day, we hoped for peace, but it turned into despair. The country was reduced to absolute zero. I remember the events of that day vividly,” he explained, noting that even his own father, an educated man, was unable to foresee the terror that would unfold.

“My father was a supporter of Sihanouk and helped the Angkar Revolution. Despite the hardships, I am proud to work at the DC-Cam, preserving our history for future generations,” he added.

In addition to the Phnom Penh collection, DC-Cam is preparing to establish another Queen Mother Library in Stung Treng province’s Borey O’Svay district. The new centre will open next month.

DC-Cam, founded in 1995 and established as an independent research institution in 1997, is dedicated to storing and researching documents from the Khmer Rouge regime for future generations.
