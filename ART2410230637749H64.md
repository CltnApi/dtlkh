Members of the public check their names and details in the communes where they are registered to vote on October 23. NEC

The National Election Committee (NEC) has announced the delisting of 111,889 names from the 2024 voter list. The updated list contains nearly 10 million names.

The announcement was made as the NEC hosted a meeting with various stakeholders on October 21. In attendance were 64 individuals, including representatives from government ministries, 15 political parties, civil society organisations and NGOS, as well as journalists.

“Voters can be removed from the list for various reasons, including change of address, death, duplicate names or legal disenfranchisement,” explained election committee member Yich Samethy.

He presented updated figures for the Kingdom’s electoral roll. It now includes a total of 9,992,421 registered voters, including 5,304,855 women. 

According to the NEC, an estimated 224,156 people became eligible to register as voters in 2024. 177,568 have been added to the list, or almost 80 per cent of newly qualified citizens.

The NEC reiterated that the purpose of posting the voter list – and the list of those who will be removed – is to allow the public to verify their names and personal information, and to file complaints or objections, if necessary. The lists will be posted in communes across the country from today, October 23.

All eligible voters have the right to file a complaint or objection in writing, using Complaint Form No. 1202. Complaints must be submitted to the relevant Commune/Sangkat council within five days of the posting date, by October 28.

Samethy explained that objections should be made regarding the loss of a voter’s name, unclear records or in instances where a name may have been incorrectly delisted.

He highlighted other potential issues, such as a person’s name appearing in multiple electorates or locations.

In addition, he noted that an individual may object to another person’s inclusion on the voter list, if they believed they do not meet the conditions required to take part in the democratic process.

Grounds for objection include being underage, lacking Cambodian citizenship, improper voter registration, not being resident in the commune where they are listed, imprisonment, disenfranchisement or mental illness under general guardianship, as certified by a relevant ministry. 

If a person is listed in more than one location, their name may also be challenged.

Objections must be filed with the Commune/Sangkat council by October 28.
