A crescendo of compassion is set to fill the air at Child Jesus Catholic Church in Boeung Tompun commune of Phnom Penh’s Meanchey district on November 25. 

The church will host an extraordinary charity concert, blending the beauty of music with a mission of hope. 

A _Mozart Spiritual Bouquet_ will bring together the community in a shared mission to raise funds for the construction of a 10-storey school for children with autism. 

The evening promises a harmonious blend of classical music and a powerful call to action, underscoring the universal language of music as a beacon of hope for Cambodia’s autistic children.

The parish committee approved the construction of the new facility on its campus to serve the current and future needs of children, guardians and special education teachers.

Phok Many, founder and coordinator of the Growing Special Education School (GSES), called on philanthropists to contribute funds and materials to ensure a modern, spacious school building for the children.

“The school management, guardians, children with autism and the staff of GSES will forever remember and honour the generosity of all donors,” said Many.

Under the artistic direction of Japanese mezzo-soprano Ai Iwasaki, a luminary of the Cambodia Opera Project, the concert will showcase performances by the project and _MusiCA_. 

Their rendition of Mozart’s timeless works aims to inspire not just admiration for classical music but also a deep commitment to the cause.

“Music has the power to heal, to unite and to inspire action,” said Iwasaki. “Through this concert, we hope to make a meaningful difference for these incredible children and their families.”

The evening will offer free seating for attendees, with VIP seats reserved for sponsors. A variety of sponsorship tiers – Gold ($1,000), Silver ($500) and Bronze ($100) – invite businesses and individuals to join hands in support of the initiative. 

Food, refreshments and nursery facilities for young children will ensure a comfortable and inclusive experience for all.

Since its establishment in 2017, GSES has been a lifeline for families grappling with the challenges of raising children with autism in a country where resources are scarce and stigma looms large.

From its humble beginnings in a rented flat, the school now serves 313 children across three rented flats, each striving to meet the increasing demand for specialised education and therapy. 

The ambitious new school project – featuring classrooms, therapy spaces, sensory rooms, a nursery and a swimming pool – represents a transformative leap. 

With an estimated cost of $1.65 million, the project still requires $1 million to become a reality.

At the heart of GSES is Many, the mother of an autistic child and the school’s founder and coordinator. 

Her firsthand experience with the struggles of accessing education for children with special needs motivated her to launch this pioneering project.

“I wanted to give the opportunity of education to students who would otherwise have nowhere to go,” said Many. “This project is more than just a building; it’s a symbol of hope and equality.”

The impact of GSES extends beyond the classroom. By providing appropriate education for children with autism, the school also alleviates the stress on families. Parents can work, grandparents can rest and family relationships often improve dramatically.

**Rays of hope**

Kem Davonn shared that her son attended the school for seven years, beginning at age four, before transitioning to a general education school in first grade. 

Now in second grade, she reflected, “When he first started school, he didn’t know how to call his parents, couldn’t answer questions, spoke very little and displayed very challenging behaviour.”

After attending GSES, her son became more vocal, self-reliant and calm. Davonn, like many parents of children with autism, expressed her gratitude for the school. 

“Without this school, it would have been very hard because we couldn’t afford private school fees, which start at $20 per hour,” she said.

Though her son left GSES two years ago, Davonn remains committed to supporting the school’s efforts. 

“I am very grateful to the school and the teachers who put their hearts into teaching. If it weren’t for them, my son wouldn’t be able to attend school like other children,” she told _The Post_. 

“As soon as I heard the school planned to build its own building, my husband and I immediately contributed. I’m more than 100 per cent in support.”

This story is one of many, as more than 50 children have transitioned from GSES to general education schools. 

Many said so far, 46 students have fully integrated, while 10 are still attending both GSES and general schools. 

“I expect these 10 children to be fully integrated into general education schools next year,” Many told _The Post_.

**A broader call for inclusion**

Despite these successes, the journey toward inclusivity is fraught with challenges. Social stigma and limited resources often marginalise children with autism, leaving families without support. 

Many explained that some families face discrimination when attempting to integrate their children into mainstream schools.

“In many public places, there is a deep-seated prejudice against children with disabilities,” she said. “This can deeply hurt both the parents and the children.”

The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that one in 100 children globally has autism spectrum disorder (ASD), though data specific to Cambodia is limited. 

This highlights an urgent need for increased awareness, research and resources to support children with autism and their families in low- and middle-income countries.

In 2019, more than 1,000 children with autism were identified in 25 districts of six provinces, according to Chan Sarin, principal of Takhmao Special Education High School in Kandal province’s Takhmao town.

He estimated there were more than 20,000 children with autism in the country.

**One church’s commitment**

Child Jesus Catholic Church, led by Friar Francois Hemelsdael, has played a crucial role in supporting GSES. 

Recognising the importance of inclusive education, it allocated land for the new school building and has championed the initiative as part of its mission to serve the community.

Founded in 1993, the church has long been a hub for community support, hosting Sunday Mass for over 500 worshippers and offering catechism classes for all ages. 

Its collaboration with GSES reflects a shared commitment to fostering education and dignity for all children, regardless of their abilities.

**How you can help**

Every ticket and sponsorship will directly contribute to a brighter future for Cambodia’s autistic children.

The event invites the community to “transform melodies into milestones”, uniting in a shared vision of hope and inclusion.

For those unable to attend, donations are welcome. Contributions can be made directly to the Growing Special Education School or through event sponsors.
