Minister of Information Neth Pheaktra has warned an influential gathering of ASEAN members about the growing threat posed by the spread of fake news and the increasing role of artificial intelligence (AI) in media.

Addressing the attendees of the 59th ASEAN Committee on Culture and Information (ASEAN-COCI) on November 28, the minister outlined the critical implications of misinformation, emphasising its role in fostering violence, hatred and social unrest.

“Fake news is a major factor in the rise of violence, hatred, racism and social unrest in many countries around the world,” he cautioned.

The minister's remarks set the tone for the launch of the government’s “Say No to Fake News” campaign, a national initiative designed to raise public awareness about the damaging effects of misinformation. 

The campaign has received broad support not only from the ASEAN member nations but also from international partners, reflecting growing concern over the influence of fake news in the digital age.

Pheaktra highlighted the role of media institutions in ensuring information security.

“The credibility of media institutions is not only a matter of journalistic ethics but also the foundation of our national security and social stability,” he declared.

His comments align with Cambodia’s broader strategy to secure the information landscape and uphold the integrity of public discourse.

During the meeting, he reiterated the importance of media participation in combating misinformation, referring to the Phnom Penh Media Statement from the 7th meeting of the Media Forum, which focused on “Fighting Fake News in the Digital Age to Maintain Peace”.

The statement calls for collaborative regional efforts to address the rising challenges posed by the digital revolution and the viral spread of misleading information.

The 59th ASEAN-COCI meeting, which runs from November 26 to 30, is an important forum for discussing cooperation in cultural and informational matters within Southeast Asia. 

The event provides a platform for ASEAN members to enhance ties, share experiences and plan joint initiatives aimed at improving communication networks and fostering deeper cultural understanding in the region.

Cambodia’s leadership in hosting the meeting reflects its ongoing commitment to regional diplomacy and the promotion of cultural initiatives. 

Pheaktra acknowledged the importance of ASEAN-COCI’s work, which has successfully facilitated various projects on heritage conservation, media development and cross-cultural exchange since its establishment in 1977.

This year’s meeting also coincides with Cambodia’s ongoing efforts to strengthen the professionalism of the media industry.

Following the 12th General Assembly of the International Conference of Asian Political Parties (ICAPP), where representatives from 28 political parties and 15 countries gathered earlier this month, Cambodia reaffirmed its dedication to press freedom and the protection of journalists. 

According to the information ministry, the implementation of the “Charter for Professional Journalism” is a key step in this direction, promoting ethical standards and ensuring media safety in an increasingly digital world.

Cambodia’s engagement in ASEAN-COCI activities continues to enhance its position as a leader in regional cultural diplomacy, it added.

“As the Kingdom hosts this significant meeting for the third time – following previous sessions in 1999 and 2014 – it remains committed to strengthening ASEAN unity and addressing the emerging challenges of the 21st century, including the fight against fake news and the ethical use of technology,” it continued.
