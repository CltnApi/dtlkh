# Press freedom in Cambodia: A tug of war between repression and reform

An information ministry press conference on its first-ever press freedom survey, “The State of Press Freedom in Cambodia”, held in April 2023. AKP

Tep Asnarith, spokesperson for the Ministry of Information, responded to the recently released report by the Cambodian Center for Human Rights (CCHR) on press freedom and freedom of expression in the country, criticising it for lacking a comprehensive evaluation of facts and relevant laws in each situation.

While acknowledging the report as a valuable effort, Asnarith expressed reservations about its methodology and conclusions, emphasising the importance of multi-stakeholder collaboration in evaluating and promoting press freedom.

The report paints a troubling picture of the state of press freedom and freedom of expression in Cambodia. 

The 43-page document, covering the period from September 1, 2023 to August 31, 2024 draws attention to significant challenges faced by journalists, human rights defenders and activists, asserting that the government's growing control over media and public discourse is stifling free expression.

Released on November 26, it highlights how restrictive legislation, government repression and a culture of self-censorship have become major barriers to the practical realisation of these fundamental rights. 

The findings underscore a media environment that is becoming increasingly hostile to dissent, with journalists and activists facing legal action, physical harassment and online abuse.

“According to the findings, the Cambodian government’s tightening grip on media and public discourse has led to increasing constraints on journalists and activists, stifling free expression and discouraging critical voices,” the report reads. 

Despite constitutional guarantees for freedom of expression, the document reveals that individuals who attempt to exercise their right to free speech often face serious repercussions, ranging from arrests to legal charges.

The report cites alarming statistics, noting that three media licenses were revoked during the past year, including those of Life and Sport News and Khmer Sport News. 

Legal actions were initiated against at least 17 journalists, resulting in 15 arrests, five detentions and three convictions. 

Human rights defenders (HRDs) were also disproportionately targeted, with 50 individuals facing legal action, including 40 who were summoned, 32 questioned and 23 arrested.

The report further discusses the heightened vulnerability of female journalists, who face unique challenges in the workplace. 

In addition to gender-based discrimination, female reporters are often subjected to physical and online harassment, making it even more difficult for them to work freely and safely. 

The report also underscores the ongoing lack of access to public information, which further complicates the work of journalists and human rights defenders who rely on transparency for their reporting.

**Scope and methodology questioned**

Asnarith noted that the ministry had not yet officially received the CCHR report. However, he welcomed the contribution to the discourse on press freedom, human rights and freedom of expression. He emphasised that such work must be based on comprehensive and scientifically grounded assessments.

“In this sense, the report that has been prepared does not yet reflect the overall value of freedom, including the value of participation and the accuracy of the information used when examined and evaluated against scientific principles,” Asnarith told _The Post_.

“The participation of all stakeholders is essential to ensure thoroughness, accuracy, quality, value and reliability,” Asnarith stated. 

Referring to the report’s summary, he noted that it relied on general observations and incorporated information from publications by other organisations and institutions. He added that even the report’s authors acknowledged its limitations.

He stressed that such reports must involve input from all relevant actors, including responsible authorities, and consider all aspects, such as incident reports, to assess the potential impact on freedom of expression. 

"It is not an accurate assessment that can be trusted by relevant actors, especially citizens," he said.

**Press freedom efforts highlighted**

Asnarith emphasised that press freedom is enshrined in the Cambodian Constitution and supported by the country’s press law and other legal instruments. 

He pointed to substantial efforts by the ministry and government to uphold these freedoms.

“The Ministry of Information has taken significant measures to safeguard all freedoms enshrined in the Constitution and related laws,” he said. 

These efforts include providing legal support to journalists and facilitating the practice of journalism through updated records and official identification cards.

According to Asnarith, nearly 2,000 media organisations and 26 media associations are currently registered with the ministry. 

More than 8,000 journalist identification cards have been issued, ensuring that practitioners operate within the legal framework.

**Journalist sentiment contrasts with report**

Contrary to CCHR’s findings, Asnarith pointed to surveys conducted by the ministry and relevant institutions indicating that press freedom in Cambodia had improved. 

He stated that 79.8 per cent of journalists surveyed reported that press freedom had improved, and they felt completely free to practice journalism safely and effectively. 

“These studies are conducted by Cambodians and reflect the reality of press freedom through scientific evaluation,” he said. 

He added that the ministry has supported journalists in resolving legal disputes and addressing professional misconduct.

In the first half of 2024, the ministry reportedly resolved 20 disputes and assisted with legal defence in ongoing court proceedings for registered journalists. 

Additionally, in the third quarter, 17 cases of professional misconduct were addressed through education and guidance on implementing the Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct for Journalists.

**Challenges and the way forward**

While defending Cambodia’s progress in promoting press freedom, Asnarith acknowledged challenges remain. 

He argued that fostering press freedom and protecting journalists require ongoing efforts from all stakeholders, including civil society, media professionals and government institutions.

“Promoting press freedom, freedom of expression and human rights cannot be achieved by any single individual or group alone,” Asnarith stated. 

He reiterated the government’s commitment to creating a safe and supportive environment for journalists who adhere to ethical standards and legal requirements.

**Divergent views on press freedom**

The CCHR report, which highlights significant challenges to press freedom and freedom of expression, noted that international organisations like Reporters Without Borders have ranked Cambodia 151st in their 2024 World Press Freedom Index, classifying the country’s press freedom situation as “very serious”.

Asnarith, however, dismissed such assessments as incomplete, reiterating that the country’s press freedom must be evaluated in the context of its legal framework and socioeconomic development.

“Supporting journalists remains a top priority for the ministry and the government,” he said. “We are committed to fostering confidence and protection for journalists who are properly registered, adhere to ethical standards and perform their duties within the legal framework.”
