The Apsara National Authority (ANA) has successfully completed the restoration of the head of a Makara sculpture, part of an ancient drainage system, located at the dam in Siem Reap province’s Teuk Likh village, in Svay Leu district’s Boeng Mealea commune.

The project, which began in mid-May, was part of the authority's ongoing efforts to preserve the Kingdom’s rich cultural heritage.

The Makara, a mythical Hindu water creature with a dragon-like serpentine appearance, is an integral part of Cambodia’s ancient water management system.

Over centuries, natural erosion and a lack of maintenance had caused significant damage to the structure, rendering it non-functional as a drainage system. Stones from the sculpture were scattered, its foundation eroded and its original shape lost.

ANA engineer Boeuth Sopak, who was part of the restoration effort, explained the meticulous process undertaken by the team. 

“To restore the drainage system of the Makara sculpture, the team mapped out the scattered rocks, excavated, registered the rocks, repaired and strengthened the damaged ones, and then restored the Makara’s body to its original shape,” she explained, as quoted by the Ministry of Culture and Fine Arts.

The section which was restored is 18 metres in length. The foundations were also strengthened, to ensure the valuable piece of cultural heritage is protected in the coming years. Culture ministry

“In addition, the team studied the foundations to ensure the sculpture’s long-term stability and protect it from water erosion, which has been the main cause of its deterioration,” she added.

The restoration, which covered an 18-metre stretch of the drainage system, involved state-of-the-art techniques blended with traditional craftsmanship to preserve the integrity of the ancient structure. 

According to the ministry, the restoration has returned the sculpture to its original function and appearance, making it a significant attraction for cultural tourism.

The sculpture is part of a broader archaeological site near the ancient diving dam, which also features a historic stone quarry used for temple construction in ancient times. 

During the restoration process, the ANA also improved access to the site by upgrading the surrounding roadways, making it easier for tourists to visit this remarkable piece of history.

Located approximately 3 kilometres southwest of the Boeng Mealea temple, the restored Makara sculpture is expected to draw visitors who are keen to explore its intricate craftsmanship and historical significance.
