At least 10 tonnes of counterfeit goods and frozen meat were destroyed following investigations and seizures conducted by authorities in Battambang province and Phnom Penh in recent weeks.

A total of 7,710kg (771 bags) of corn seeds bearing the "Sun Smile 99999" logo were incinerated at a landfill located in Anlong Vil commune in Battambang’s Sangke district. The action was taken due to the counterfeit nature of the product, which violated the intellectual property (IP) rights of the original company, Sun Smile Import Export Co Ltd, according to the provincial police on Thursday, November 7.

Im Kosal, spokesperson and provincial deputy police chief, said that the company discovered the distribution and sale of the seeds in various markets and depots, particularly in areas near the Cambodia-Thailand border. 

He added that the trade and sale of these items infringed on the company's IP rights, prompting its lawyer to file a legal complaint with the provincial court.

Under the direction of a provincial court prosecutor, the economic crime department police carried out the seizure at a depot in February. 

The confiscated items were stored at the provincial police station until the court approved their destruction, which took place on Monday, November 4 with participation from the company’s lawyer.

The police also questioned the owner of the depot involved in selling the seeds. However, the owner claimed they were merely a seller who had acquired the product from others and was unaware of the distributors' identities, he said. 

He noted that further investigation by the company and the court is ongoing to identify those responsible for the intellectual property violation.

“The company investigated and found the product was counterfeit, so they filed a complaint with a prosecutor. We questioned the seller, who could not identify who sold the product to them,” he said.

“The seller was also a victim because they were unaware. Therefore, there was no fine or detention for the seller, and the company is pursuing the source of the counterfeit product,” he added.

Separately, the Consumer Protection, Competition and Fraud Repression Directorate-General (CCF) of the Ministry of Commerce destroyed 2,611kg of frozen meat on November 1 at a landfill in Choeung Ek commune in Phnom Penh’s Dangkor district.

The CCF stated that the frozen meat – comprising pork, pig organs, frozen ducks and chicken wings – did not meet regulations, violated technical standards, was of poor quality, lacked hygiene and was illegal. 

The confiscated meat was found at storage, sale and distribution sites in Phnom Penh’s Chamkarmon district.

The government extended the temporary suspension on imports of frozen pork entrails and parts for an additional six months, effective from September 12 to March 12, 2025. 

The ban does not apply to imports by approved investment projects using the goods as production inputs for export.
