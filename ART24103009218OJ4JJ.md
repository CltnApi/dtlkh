The Global Alumni Convention (GAC) is poised to celebrate its milestone 10th edition this November, featuring the Global Education and Career Expo. The event will attract thousands of students, professionals and educational institutions from countries including Australia, New Zealand, the UK, Ireland, the US and Canada.

The convention will kick off with an official opening and gala dinner on November 8, bringing together alumni from around the world, representatives from local and international institutions, officials from ministries and embassies, entrepreneurs, CEOs and leaders from various sectors.

According to Mao Sreng, GAC convenor and country director of IDP Education and the Australian Centre for Education (ACE), the convention has played an instrumental role in shaping the futures of countless students. 

"GAC provides a dynamic networking platform where participants can engage with individuals who have made significant impacts through their education abroad, inspiring others to pursue their own academic aspirations."

Following the gala, the Global Education and Career Expo will take place on November 9 at Sofitel Phnom Penh and November 10 at Sofitel Siem Reap.

“This event offers a unique opportunity for students to engage with representatives from secondary, vocational and higher education institutions worldwide. This interaction empowers them to make informed decisions that will shape their educational journeys and drive their future success,” Sreng added.

In addition to the expo, the convention will feature panel discussions with experts, alumni and industry leaders, providing valuable insights into international education, career development and the skills needed for success in today’s interconnected world.
