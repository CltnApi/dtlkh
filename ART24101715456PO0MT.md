Tourists are filming themselves running around sacred Cambodian landmark Angkor Wat to mimic the old mobile game Temple Run. Some conservationists who work at the site are appalled by the trend.

A TikTok trend to recreate a classic mobile game is causing quite a stir.

Clips showing people recreating ‘Temple Run’ while running around the sacred Cambodian landmark Angkor Wat have been racking up millions of views.

The game, and its many spinoffs, shows a character running through ruins and landscapes while trying to avoid obstacles and chasing creatures. The background to the original 2011 game looks very similar to Angkor Wat.
