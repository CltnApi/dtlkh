Cambodia is preparing to expand its environmental diplomacy on the international stage by showcasing the country’s cleanliness during the 16th meeting of the Conference of the Parties (COP16) to the UN Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD), being held in Cali, Colombia with nearly 200 countries in attendance.

Minister of Environment Eang Sophalleth, representing Prime Minister Hun Manet, is leading the country’s high-level delegation to the conference, which takes place from October 21 to November 1.

Before his departure on the night of October 26, the minister emphasised that the country’s primary goal is to broaden its international environmental diplomacy and promote the country's cleanliness.

"As I’ve mentioned, Cambodia’s beauty comes in three forms: the cleanliness of its mindset, the cleanliness within its borders and the cleanliness it brings to the international stage. This participation in COP16 will promote Cambodia’s efforts and prevent any misunderstandings about the country," he explained.

Sophalleth further noted that the conference will address how the global community can protect, conserve and develop biodiversity in various nations.

The 196 participating countries will present their challenges and propose solutions, with an effort to mobilise approximately $700 billion annually. These funds will be distributed to developing countries, including Cambodia, to support biodiversity conservation both domestically and internationally.

"Cambodia will deliver a national statement at the conference, reflecting its commitment to protecting the country’s natural resources. This will highlight our dedication to biodiversity conservation in Cambodia," Sophalleth stated.

According to the ministry, the country is well-prepared to tackle global challenges alongside the international community, based on its strategies and high-level commitment.

The delegation will showcase national policies, environmental strategies and efforts to protect and conserve the country’s natural resources. Key initiatives include reducing plastic use, increasing tree planting to enhance forest cover, advancing the digital sector, strengthening international cooperation for biodiversity conservation and improving livelihoods in local communities.

In addition to delivering a speech at the conference, Sophalleth will meet with leaders from friendly countries, development partners and private sector representatives to further strengthen and expand cooperation in natural resource management and biodiversity conservation, promoting sustainable living.

The COP15 conference, held in Montreal, Canada in 2022, resulted in an international agreement, known as 30x30, to protect 30 per cent of the world's land and oceans by 2030.
