The Prambei Mom Community Forest in Kampong Speu province is appealing to donors to provide patrol equipment to support their conservation work, which includes protecting hundreds of wildlife species and other natural resources for future generations.

The community highlighted that traps remain a significant threat to wildlife, requiring the 14-member community committee to conduct daily patrols, day and night, to prevent illegal activities.

Community head Soeun Lay said that inspections are conducted across the 1,221-hectare community land in Thpong district’s Trapeang Kraeunh village and in surrounding areas where wildlife roam.

Lay noted that the team faces challenges in carrying out their work, including a shortage of equipment, uniforms and funds for motorcycle repairs, food and especially fuel.

Each month, they need up to eight containers (240 litres) of gasoline, while the Wildlife Alliance currently supports only three containers per month.

He stated, “From late July to December, we need to patrol both day and night to remove traps and protect wildlife, as this period sees heavy rain, and wildlife appears more frequently.”

According to Lay, the community forest is home to hundreds of wild animals, including banteng, gaur, pangolins, jackals, red muntjac, wild pigs, porcupines and peacocks.

“Without patrols, the animals fall into traps. When we patrol, poachers are less likely to set traps. That’s why we keep up continuous patrols. Our efforts to patrol day and night have significantly reduced the number of traps in our community land,” he said.

The community said on its social media that traps are “silent weapons” that indiscriminately kill animals. For over 20 years, traps have consistently been set both outside and inside the community, causing injuries and deaths to wildlife every year.

Another obstacle the patrol team faces is restrictions imposed by a company adjacent to the community land, which prevents them from entering to search for traps.

“They continue to patrol within the conservation zone daily. We appeal to donors to support them because our natural resources are dwindling. They tirelessly dedicate their strength and spirit, day or night, through rain or shine, without pay, despite family hardships,” the post read.

“Without their conservation efforts, we risk losing our natural resources, especially wildlife and biodiversity,” it added.

“What does the future hold if traps and electric snares continue to kill wildlife? Despite our Prambei Mom Community Forest patrols' best efforts, the traps are never fully gone,” the community expressed concern.

On Sunday, November 3, a group of young people plans to plant trees and provide support for the community’s patrol team. They are calling on the public to contribute donations to support the group, with each donation package costing around 40,000 riel ($10).
