Jose Munoz, head coach of Preah Khan Reach Svay Rieng FC, has explained the main reason why veteran forward Prak Mony Udom has not yet made it into the starting lineup, despite reported good health and impressive form during training.

This question was raised by journalists during a November 26 press conference. Many fans have been wondering why the former national representative has not been given a chance to play, considering his past reputation and current fitness.

 “There is no issue with Mony Udom in the team. Initially, he had a minor injury, but after recovering, he has been training very well,” clarified coach Munoz.

However, he acknowledged that the level of competition within the team has made it difficult for Mony Udom to earn a spot in the starting eleven.

“It’s tough for him get a place in the starting lineup right now because there is a lot of competition for spots, but I am pleased with what he has done so far, especially in training. He always works hard and performs like a professional athlete,” he added.

Coach Munoz expressed his hopes that Mony Udom will get an opportunity to play in future matches, especially as the 2024-2025 season progresses. The team is set to host Life FC from Preah Sihanouk on Wednesday night at the Svay Rieng Provincial Stadium, with the club aiming to secure three more league points.

“Life FC has been very competitive recently. They’ve earned four points from their last two games, and they’ve been improving their team chemistry and creating more goal-scoring opportunities. They are not an easy team to play against, but we have to perform well in this match if we want to collect three points,” he added.

Under the guidance of new coach Jorg Peter Steinebrunner, Life FC achieved their first win of the season by defeating ISI Dangkor Senchey 1-0 on November 9. They followed that up with a 1-1 draw against National Police Commissary FC on November 22, bringing their total to 6 points from 11 matches, with one win, three draws, and seven losses.

Despite their recent improvements, Coach Steinebrunner recognised the challenge his coastal side faces in their upcoming match against Svay Rieng, a team that has reached the group stages of the 2024/2025 AFC Challenge League, a major achievement for Cambodian football.

“We must respect Preah Khan Reach Svay Rieng,” he said.

“They have quality players and are well-organised. However, in football, we want to show what we are capable of and aim to score against them. We have to believe in ourselves and keep pushing for the full 90 minutes,” he continued.
