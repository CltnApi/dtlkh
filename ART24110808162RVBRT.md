The Ministry of Tourism has called on tour operators to play a stronger role in promoting Cambodia’s annual Water Festival to international audiences.

In collaboration with the National Committee for Organizing National and International Festivals, the ministry aims to attract worldwide visitors to experience this cultural extravaganza, immerse themselves in Khmer traditions and celebrate the unique heritage of Cambodia.

“The tourism ministry will organise a dedicated viewing platform located to the north of the main VIP platform in front of the Royal Palace for international tourists to enjoy the boat races, lantern-floating ceremony and moon-worship ceremony during the Water Festival,” said a ministry statement.

“It will also provide hospitality services for international tourists, including tourist guide services, along with large screens displaying information about various potential tourist destinations in Cambodia,” it added.

The Water Festival, or Bon Om Touk, is set to take place from November 14 to 16, along the Tonle Sap River in front of the Royal Palace in Phnom Penh. 

This ancient celebration, which marks the reversal of the river’s flow, features vibrant boat races, lantern-floating ceremonies and moon worship rituals, each of them offering guests a glimpse into some of the kingdom’s most deep-rooted customs.

Nhim Saphorn, acting director of the ministry’s Department of Domestic Public Awareness, highlighted how the collaboration with tour operators is a key strategy to boost tourism. 

“We urge tourism operators to integrate the Water Festival into their offerings. Sometimes, group tours are arranged during the holiday period, and we can invite guests to join the festival. This is an opportunity for operators to showcase Khmer culture to international visitors,” he explained.

Saphorn noted that the pavilion set up for foreign guests has a capacity of 300 seats, accommodating hundreds of visitors daily.

In previous years, it welcomed over 8,000 tourists during the three-day event, with many enjoying the freedom to explore the festival grounds and engage with locals.

The ministry also encouraged media outlets and influencers to focus on promoting Cambodia’s positive tourism potential, helping to attract more visitors. 

“The tourism minister calls on journalists and social media influencers to showcase Cambodia’s beauty and avoid negative portrayals that could deter travellers,” Saphorn told The Post.

Local tour operators, such as Chea Thong of Vana Adventure Travel – a local family-operated tour company, offering a variety of adventure experiences – are taking steps to encourage participation.

While Thong’s company has not organised specific programmes for the festival, he recommends it as a must-see experience for tourists and expatriates alike. 

"We encourage them to join the Water Festival viewing platform so they don’t feel discouraged by the crowds,” Thong told The Post. 

“The festival is a fantastic opportunity to connect with Khmer culture and join people from all provinces in celebrating this unique tradition,” he said.

Thong also revealed his plans to host the first Phnom Penh Year-End Bird Count during the upcoming New Year, an event that will debut in Phnom Penh.
