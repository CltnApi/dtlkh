Planning for a powerful celebration of inclusion and empowerment is underway, with a series of special guests set to take the stage on November 23, at Factory Phnom Penh.

The Youth Light Up Talk, initiated by the “Youth Ambassadors” team and supported by the USAID Cambodia Advancing Youth Leadership programme, is a pioneering event designed to ignite discussions on societal norms, foster inclusivity and spotlight young leaders from diverse backgrounds.

With the theme “”Empower Youth Leaders, Light Up Marginalised Voices”, this year’s event aims to amplify the stories of marginalised communities. 

People with disabilities, members of the LGBTQI+ community, indigenous populations and mainstream youth will share personal stories of resilience and transformation, bringing greater visibility to their struggles and achievements.

“This event provides a space where the stories of marginalised communities are heard and valued. We believe empowerment thrives in diversity, fostering an inclusive society for all,” said Nann Pechpheary, a Youth Ambassadors representative.

Cheng Sereysothyka, a Youth Light Up Talk volunteer, expressed how honoured she feels to be a part of this inclusive event and her gratitude for the opportunity to support inclusivity. 

She explained how she is looking forward to seeing the event unfold and to sharing inspiring stories with the audience members.

“I believe that their experience at this event will be rewarding,” she added.
