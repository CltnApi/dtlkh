A mixed force of more than 16,000 personnel will be deployed to ensure security, order and safety during the Water Festival (Bon Om Touk), which begins tomorrow, November 14. Participants are advised to avoid pushing or crowding to prevent fainting and heatstroke.

National Police chief Sar Thet highlighted in a security planning meeting on November 12 that festival preparations have included collaboration with local authorities, ministries and institutions to ensure a smooth and incident-free festival, according to the National Police on Thursday, November 13.

“Under the peaceful and prosperous conditions of the nation, this year’s celebration of Bon Om Touk will be organised on a grander scale than in previous years,” he said.

This year’s festivities will feature 346 competing boats with over 20,000 rowers, 36 lantern boats (pratip) and 10 locations for musical performances, boxing and other events.

He urged all security forces assigned to protect the festival to carry out their duties responsibly, ensuring the safety of the King, the prime minister, high-ranking officials, dignitaries and citizens from across the country who are attending the celebrations.

The joint force, comprising more than 16,000 personnel, includes members from 16 institutions and units, such as the National Police, Military Police, Bodyguard Unit, National Counter-Terrorism Committee (NCTC), Navy Command, special regional military units and other related ministries and institutions.

During the festival from November 14-16, the Ministry of Health advised attendees, "Avoid pushing or crowding to prevent heatstroke. If you feel dizzy or faint, sit down to prevent a fall and seek assistance."

The ministry has also set up 15 medical tents and stationed medical teams and ambulances at key points to provide emergency assistance to citizens.

During the festival, individuals with health concerns can consult nearby health posts and centres or state hospitals. Additionally, those experiencing fever, cough, difficulty breathing or other issues are advised to avoid crowded areas.

The ministry also warned, “Exercise caution \[with\] rice wines and traditional herbal wines to prevent potential methanol poisoning, which can cause severe illness or death. Methanol should not be used to produce rice wine or herbal wine, as it is not a safe form of alcohol.”
