# Interview: The state of South Korean tourism in Cambodia post-Covid-19

A large group of South Korean tourists arrived at Siem Reap International Airport (REP) in October 2023. Siem Reap provincial information department

_Similar to other tourism markets, the number of South Korean tourists in Cambodia remains below pre-Covid-19 levels due to various factors._

_According to data from the Ministry of Tourism, the country received 132,286 Korean tourists between January and August, a 14.6% increase compared to the same period last year. In 2019, there were 254,847 Korean tourists, placing Korea as the fourth largest source market after China, Vietnam, Thailand and Laos._

_The Post’s reporter **Niem Chheng** sat down with **Seam Sokkheng**, president of the Korean Language Tourist Guide Association in Cambodia, to gain insights into the market, especially with recent coverage in Korean media about reports of detention and coercion involving Korean nationals._

**What has been the situation of Korean tourists in Cambodia since the country reopened post-Covid-19 in November 2021 and how does it compare to 2019 levels?**

After COVID-19, there was a significant influx of Korean tourists until the end of February 2022, after which the numbers gradually declined. At that time, direct flights from Korea to Siem Reap helped drive these numbers. 

However, with the discontinuation of direct flights, fewer Korean tourists are coming. Now, they must arrive in Phnom Penh before continuing to Siem Reap or travel to Siem Reap directly from neighbouring countries, but their numbers are limited.

Currently, I estimate that Korean tourist numbers are only about 30 per cent of what they were before Covid-19. As I mentioned, the main issue is the lack of direct flights. If they were available, I believe the numbers would be much closer to previous levels.

**Have South Korean tourists raised any concerns when visiting Cambodia, especially given recent reports of South Korean nationals claiming to have been detained and coerced by criminals?**

As a Korean-speaking tour guide, I personally have not encountered Korean tourists expressing concerns about their trips to Cambodia. The main complaint I hear from them is the absence of direct flights, which makes travel more difficult. Aside from that, they don’t bring up other issues. They enjoy their time in Siem Reap and find it safe.

Regarding the recent Korean news reports about South Koreans allegedly being detained and coerced, this is relatively new. Even with these reports circulating, I continue to guide Korean tourists around the temples, but they showed no reaction or concern about these issues. 

From my experience with them directly, they don’t bring up such matters. Upon arriving in Siem Reap, they see the real situation, which is different from the reports, and they seem to enjoy their trip without any issues.

**As the president of the Korean Language Tourist Guide Association, what would you like to tell South Korean citizens about the situation in Cambodia?**

I encourage Koreans to continue visiting Cambodia, especially Siem Reap, as the actual situation in Siem Reap and throughout Cambodia is not as portrayed in some news reports. I encourage them to come explore Khmer culture as Siem Reap is safe and offers unique attractions where they can learn and experience new things. 

Concerns like scams are part of the black market and don’t relate to tourism. We can assure them that in Cambodia and in Siem Reap, there is no such issue at all.

**What has your association done to help boost the Korean tourism market in Cambodia?**

First, we have strengthened our members’ knowledge to enhance their ability to provide accurate information to tourists and to offer a smooth travel experience. We focus on meeting the needs and requests of our tourists. Additionally, we have promoted Cambodia in Korean media through bloggers, YouTubers and other social platforms.

**Do you have any recommendations to encourage the return of Korean tourists to Cambodia?**

I urge relevant ministries, especially Cambodia’s Ministry of Tourism and Korea’s Ministry of Tourism, to collaborate on promoting Cambodia’s tourism more widely. I also encourage collaboration with airlines to establish direct flights from Korea to Siem Reap.

If we increase promotion and restore direct flights, I believe Korean tourists will visit Siem Reap on their own without difficulty. As Korean-speaking guides, we are fully prepared to meet the needs of tourists and provide a quality travel experience.
