New head coach Conor Nestor led Boeung Ket against Visakha in a rain-soaked match on Saturday. CPL

Phnom Penh Crown continues to dominate the 2024-2025 Cambodian Premier League (CPL), achieving a remarkable tenth consecutive victory without a single loss. In stark contrast, Boeung Ket is grappling with the heat of the intense competition, even after bringing in former Preah Khan Reach Svay Rieng coach Conor Nestor to lead the team.

In the recent eleventh week of league matches, Crown narrowly defeated ISI Dangkor Sen Chey 1-0, thanks to a decisive goal from striker Jelle Joost Goselink in the 53rd minute. The victory solidified their position at the top of the league with 30 points, while also marking them as the only team to have won all ten of their matches thus far.

Boeung Ket, on the other hand, is under mounting pressure following their eighth defeat against Visakha, who triumphed 1-0 thanks to a goal from Brazilian forward Ramon de Andrade Souza. The loss pushed Boeung Ket down to seventh place in the standings with just 22 points from four wins, two draws and three losses.

The outcome left Boeung Ket supporters frustrated, leading to clashes between fans during the match, held at Prince Stadium. Many are now calling for changes within the club, suggesting the need for new players to restore the team's former glory. The team claimed the league title four times between 2012 and 2020.

Nestor, who took over as head coach on October 7, acknowledges the challenges ahead. 

Following the loss to Visakha, he said, “People might think that my return to Boeung Ket would allow me to be a miracle worker, but I’m just a coach, not a magician who can instantly change the team’s fortunes.”

Nestor recalled his successful tenure with Preah Khan Reach Svay Rieng from 2018 to 2023, where he led the team to a league title in 2019 and a chance to compete in the AFC Cup 2020 group stage. 

He emphasised the importance of time in building a successful team.

“When you want to create something good, you need time. However, we have limited time and we need to act quickly,” he acknowledged.

Despite the challenges, Nestor is committed to preparing the team not just to win matches but to develop a stronger foundation for future success.

“Our goal isn’t just to win matches in the league; we need to prepare our players well to achieve even greater trophies,” he said.
