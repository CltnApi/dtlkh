The 11th National Nutrition Day brought together senior officials from government ministries, development partners, civil society, academia and the private sector. FAO

The Council of Minister’s Council for Agricultural and Rural Development (CARD) hosted a November 6 event to mark the 11th National Nutrition Day (NND). 

Held under the theme “Nutrition for Growth”, it focused on raising awareness of food security and nutrition, highlighting their critical roles in human capital development, economic growth and social progress.

The event also saw the launch of two major initiatives: The SDG Seed Fund and the “Enough Campaign”.

The SDG Seed Fund, a collaborative project with the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), WFP and UNICEF of the UN, aims to transform Cambodia’s food systems for sustainable and resilient growth. 

The Enough Campaign – being conducted in partnership with World Vision International Cambodia, focuses on ending child malnutrition and promoting healthier eating habits across the country.

The event was attended by more than 350 participants, including representatives from government ministries, development partners, civil society, academia and the private sector, explained a November 6 FAO press release.

Sok Silo, CARD secretary-general, addressed the opening ceremony. He highlighted the importance of a unified approach to nutrition.

“Since food security and nutrition are cross-sectoral issues, this requires good cooperation, coordination and involvement and a focus on interventions and investments in agriculture, food, health, education, environment, employment, rural development, water resources management, gender, water and sanitation and hygiene, social protection and other relevant sectors,” he said.

Council vice-chairman Lao Sokharom appealed to development partners, civil society and the private sector to support the government to efficiently implement policies, strategies and action plans for success.

His fellow vice-chairman Chea Samnang also called for improved hygiene and food handling practices across the Kingdom.

Rebekah Bell, FAO representative in Cambodia, celebrated the purpose of the day.

“Today serves as a fitting platform to discuss the way forward and how we can work together to address the ongoing challenges Cambodia is facing, such as child wasting, prevalent micronutrient deficiencies, nutritional disparities among the population groups and overweight and obesity,” she said.

“I am pleased to share that the SDG Seed Fund Joint Programme has been approved. This joint effort, guided and chaired by CARD and co-chaired by UNRC, will update Cambodia’s National Food Systems Roadmap with a focus on nutrition, climate resilience, and gender equity,” she added.  
Janes Ginting, national director at World Vision International, also reiterated the importance of nutrition.

“Children and parents, especially from rural areas, struggle to put the right food for their health and growth on the table. Despite these challenges, we remain hopeful with the unwavering and shared commitment to the success of the government’s 3rd National Strategy on Food Security and Nutrition. This event shows that there is ‘enough’ will to end child malnutrition in Cambodia,” he said.

According to the release, the event also included a presentation on the 2030 Roadmap for Sustainable Food Systems, outlining strategies to enhance sustainable food systems and nutrition outcomes in Cambodia.

“Attendees participated in breakout sessions, facilitated by FAO, WFP, UNICEF and CARD, to collaboratively develop the roadmap’s strategic framework and explore integrated, multi-sectoral solutions,” it said, adding that the day showcased a united effort among government, development partners civil society and communities.

“This collective commitment underscores the role of nutrition in driving growth, wellbeing, and a brighter future for all Cambodians,” it concluded.
