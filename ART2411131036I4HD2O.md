The Cambodian Senate has approved a draft law on wastewater systems aimed at achieving the goal of preventing and reducing wastewater discharge into seas, rivers, streams, lakes, creeks and ponds by 50 per cent by 2030, in line with UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDG).

This draft law, initially approved by the Council of Ministers on August 23 and passed by the National Assembly on October 31, was signed off by the Senate today, November 13. 

It has been under preparation by the Ministry of Public Works and Transport for more than 10 years, with 116 consultation meetings staged since 2013. The ministry has received technical support from the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) since 2000.

The final bill comprises 16 chapters and 113 articles.

A November 13 Senate press release explained that the draft law was created to manage the development, construction, repair, maintenance, operation and use of wastewater systems to ensure their effectiveness, quality, safety and sustainability, while protecting the environment and contributing to improving public health.

Clean water and sanitation have long been prioritised by the government, with these issues incorporated into national policies and strategic development plans since previous administrations. The aim is to provide access to clean water and sanitation for all citizens, focusing on sewage systems, wastewater treatment, recycling, strengthened monitoring mechanisms and pollution reduction, in order to benefit citizens and preserve Cambodia's natural resources.

The release specified that the government has set clear targets and is committed to implementing measures to prevent the discharge of untreated or improperly treated wastewater into public waterways, including streams, lakes, creeks, ponds and the ocean, with the goal of achieving a 50 per cent reduction by 2030, in accordance with the UN SDGs.

In August, the government spokesperson unit noted that while Cambodia has an existing wastewater infrastructure and is building new systems, it lacks sufficient regulatory standards for managing them, underscoring the necessity of the new law.

In the same month, the Ministry of Environment fined a coconut oil manufacturer owned by businessman Mong Reththy $10,000 (40 million riel) under Sub-Decree No. 27 on Water Pollution Control, for releasing liquid waste from its production chain into the Kampong Seila stream in Preah Sihanouk province’s Anlong Krapeu village, in Prey Nup district’s Tanei commune. The illegal dumping polluted the water, causing the death of many fish.

In August 2023, the ministry fined Phoenix Industrial over $500,000, after the company allowed toxic black wastewater to leak into the Sangke River in Battambang province. The ministry also instructed the company to relocate its factory to a new site at least 10 kilometres from the river.
