Prime Minister Hun Manet has urged private citizens not to be deceived by “land brokers” who encourage people to register for social land concessions in Mondulkiri province and has instructed authorities to take legal action against such fraudulent activities.

The appeal was made as he addressed the inauguration ceremony of the O'Te Thipadei, Sen Sokdom, and Sen Monorom development projects in Mondulkiri province on October 24.

Manet warned that some brokers are currently trying to convince people to register and pay deposits to obtain social land concessions in Pech Chreada district.

“Please do not believe anyone who tries to collect money under the pretext of registering for this land concession. It is not legitimate. Citizens, do not be deceived,” he said.

The prime minister clarified that the registration for social land concessions must follow state mechanisms and local authorities.

“If you register, it must be done through state mechanisms. In the past, we have followed land concession procedures through commune authorities. In addition, when committees are formed, there is clear public information. I urge the authorities and law enforcement to deal with these brokers because they are deceiving citizens. The provincial authorities in Pech Chreada must conduct a thorough investigation,” he said.

“A natural breeze cools and relaxes us, but this ill wind \[the land brokers’ scheme\] is a hot wind...deceiving people out of their money. Do not fall for it, and if you do, you will face legal consequences," he warned, using a traditional Khmer expression.

The Mondulkiri provincial administration reported that brokers have been misleading people from outside the province with false promises of residential and agricultural land in Valyong village, of Pech Chreada district’s Bousra commune. These individuals claimed that each family would receive a residential plot of 30 metres by 70, along with 3 hectares of agricultural land.

“There is no official guidance or approval from the government or relevant ministries regarding the distribution of land to citizens. This information is false, and being spread by brokers with the intent to deceive honest citizens," it added, in a statement.

The authorities warned citizens not to believe in the false promises of these so-called brokers, as it could lead to financial losses.

The administration noted that at present, there is only one social land concession in Mondulkiri, located in Koh Nhek district, which is designated for poor and landless citizens. Citizens can apply through the local authorities – at the village, commune, or district level – and the provincial authorities will assess their claims and provide assistance accordingly.

Neang Vannak, head of the provincial administration, announced that the authorities are establishing a task force to investigate those involved in this case, and intend to pursue legal action.

“In the past, there have been too many instances where dishonest individuals have deceived citizens, promising this and that, leading to significant financial losses. This is the corrupt mindset of these brokers. In this case, the province will take measures against the individuals responsible,” he said, on October 24.
