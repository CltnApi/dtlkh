Thong Khon, president of the National Olympic Committee of Cambodia (NOCC), has called on the Cambodia Gymnastics Federation (CGF) and its officials to begin focusing on strengthening their human resources in preparation for the 5th Asian Youth Games in 2029. Cambodia will host the event for the first time in its history.

Despite the Games being five years away, Khon emphasised the importance of developing athletes, technical staff and coaches now, so the Kingdom’s representatives have the best possible chance for success both in the games' organisation and in winning medals for the nation.

“From now until 2029, we have just five more years to ensure that the sports sector in Cambodia continues to grow, both in terms of quantity and quality, and that we achieve good results in international competitions – especially in our preparations to host the 5th Asian Youth Games,” he said.

He delivered his remarks during the closing ceremony of the 4th National Gymnastics Championship and the 2nd National Para Sports Games, held at the National Olympic Stadium in Phnom Penh on Thursday evening. The event saw the participation of 42 technical officials, 54 athletes, and 10 volunteers.

During the tournament, which spanned 13 events from November 3 to 8, the Ministry of Interior’s team emerged as the overall winner, claiming 5 gold, 7 silver and 1 bronze medals. The Ministry of National Defence took second place with 3 gold, 2 silver and 5 bronze, while Kampong Chhnang province secured third with 3 golds, 1 silver and 3 bronzes. The Kratie provincial team finished fourth with 2 golds, 3 silvers and 4 bronze medals.

Khon expressed strong interest in the many young athletes who participated, noting that they performed at a high level, with even more potential than some of the adult competitors. He encouraged the gymnastics federation to focus on developing the next generation of talented athletes, particularly young ones, in order to prepare for the upcoming youth games.

He instructed the federation to invest in youth development programmes and talent identification at the club and association levels. He also stressed the importance of training athletes in specialised skills to ensure they are fully prepared for international competition, particularly as hosts.

“Training young athletes in age-specific programmes, increasing the quantity and quality of our athletes, and selecting those with exceptional talent will be essential. We must also improve the capabilities of referees, technical staff and coaches to raise the overall level of our sports sector,” Khon explained.

In addition, he called for greater efforts to encourage athletes at all levels to participate in more competitions, both domestically and internationally. He specifically highlighted the upcoming 2025 SEA Games as an important milestone and advised that regular training should be prioritised. Strengthening the federation’s organisational structure and forming more partnerships for development will also be key in ensuring continued progress, he noted.

In response to Khon's suggestions, Noy Phana, CGF secretary-general, confirmed that he and his team of technical staff would continue working hard to improve the sector. He noted that, compared to 2022 and 2023, this year has seen significant improvements, particularly in terms of preparations for the national tournament.

“The young athletes sent by our clubs and associations are highly talented,” he said.

“If we compare this year to last, we have been able to select from a larger pool of athletes for training. As for the recommendations made by the NOCC president, we are already making progress and will continue to implement them to improve our technical capabilities,” he added.

He reiterated that the federation’s leadership is committed to ensuring that Cambodian athletes are given the best possible opportunity to succeed in the upcoming Games and beyond, both through local competitions and international exposure.

As Cambodia gears up for the 2029 Asian Youth Games, the push to enhance athletic development is crucial. The Ministry of Tourism and NOCC’s leadership, under Khon’s direction, aims to build a legacy of sporting excellence, not only for the upcoming games but for the future of each of the Kingdom’s athletes on the world stage.
