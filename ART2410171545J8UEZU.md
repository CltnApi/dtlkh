# NagaCorp-commissioned review finds Cambodia’s main short-term risks are economic, not political

An independent review of investment risks in Cambodia commissioned by NagaCorp, operator of the NagaWorld integrated resort in Phnom Penh, has found the nation’s biggest risks in 2024 are economic rather than political.

The findings of the review by Political & Economic Risk Consultancy, Ltd are set out in NagaCorp’s Interim Report, released Thursday, and paint a picture of a Cambodian economy that has “moved beyond” the COVID-19 pandemic but has not returned to its pre-pandemic levels.

“Most of the reasons for this delayed economic recovery are external,” it states, “Unfortunately, that means they are largely beyond the ability of the government to control and are likely to disappoint those hoping for a speedy rebound.”
