In a dramatic and hard-fought finale at the 4th National Games, the Prey Veng men's volleyball team emerged victorious, overcoming the Phnom Penh team in a thrilling 3-2 match to claim gold. 

The intense game, played at the National Olympic Stadium on Wednesday night, saw fans captivated by the competitive spirit of both sides and numerous nail-biting moments.

A tense battle that saw the match go the full five sets. Phnom Penh team won the first set 25-23, but Prey Veng quickly bounced back to take the second and third sets, 25-23 and 25-21, respectively.

Phnom Penh levelled the score in the fourth set, winning 25-23, forcing the match into a deciding fifth set. In a final push, Prey Veng triumphed 16-14 to claim the gold medal.

Koun Mom, one of the standout players for Prey Veng, acknowledging the tough competition they faced throughout the match.

“The Phnom Penh team has made impressive strides. Their performance in this tournament was the toughest we have encountered. They pushed us to the limit, and in the final, we were only two points ahead. It was a very tight match,” he said.

Phol Ratanak, another key player, described the match as one of the most challenging of his career.

“This final was just as tough as our previous encounter with Phnom Penh in the Sea V League Challenge, which we won back in August. We had already faced them in the group stage and lost a tough 3-2 match, so we knew we had to fight even harder in the final. It was extremely intense and stressful, but we were determined to win,” he shared.

In the women’s competition, the team from Pursat province defeated Kandal 3-1 in the final to secure the gold medal. Sides from Kampong Chhnang and Kampong Thom faced off for the bronze, with Kampong Chhnang claiming victory by the same 3-1 scoreline.
