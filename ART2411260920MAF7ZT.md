The Cambodian women’s national football team, under the leadership of head coach Khuon Laboravy, is intensifying their training to address key weaknesses ahead of their crucial match against Malaysia in the 2024 AFF Women’s Cup.

The match, set to take place in Laos on November 29, will be a decisive encounter for Cambodia’s hopes of advancing to the semifinals.

Currently positioned in Group B alongside three other regional teams, Cambodia finished their opening match against Indonesia on November 23 with a goalless draw (0-0). Despite the draw, the Cambodian team temporarily sits in first place in the group due to their superior goal difference.

Coach Laboravy, reflecting on the match against Indonesia, expressed satisfaction with his team's overall performance. 

“I’m happy with how the team played against Indonesia. Everyone followed the game plan well. We controlled the game, both defensively and offensively, and we created many chances," he said.

“However, the only thing we lacked was the finishing. Our forwards, including Soeurn Vipha, Heng Sovanmony, Chhit Sapheourn and Poeurn Kunthea, had several opportunities in the Indonesian box but were unable to convert. The most disappointing moment for the fans was when Heng Sovanmony hit the crossbar in the 15th minute,” he added.

Looking ahead to the crucial match against Malaysia, he emphasised the need for improvement in their finishing. 

“We are focusing on refining our attacking play," he stated. "We need to make sure we capitalise on the chances we create."

With only one more point needed to advance to the semifinals, Cambodia will face Malaysia in a must-win match. 

Laboravy is determined to secure a victory rather than settle for a draw. 

“We came to Laos with the goal of winning the tournament. While a draw might be enough to progress, I want to see my team win. Our focus is on taking all three points against Malaysia to keep our championship aspirations alive,” he explained.

“We are here to fight for the championship. We want to win every game, and we believe our team is capable of beating Malaysia,” he added.

Meanwhile, Indonesia will play their second match of the group stage against Malaysia at 7.00pm on November 26. A draw for Indonesia will guarantee their progression to the semifinals. Similarly, East Timor will face Singapore in their final group match, after a 1-1 draw with host nation Laos on November 23.

The stage is set for a thrilling conclusion to the group stage, with Cambodia aiming for a victory that could propel them into the semi-finals of the 2024 AFF Women’s Cup.
