Cambodian national goalkeeper Vireak Dara launches himself to contest the ball in the penalty area. He played a key role in this afternoon’s 2-1 victory. AFC

In a thrilling away encounter, Cambodia's Preah Khan Reach Svay Rieng triumphed over the home team, SP Falcons FC of Mongolia, with a score of 2-1 in the AFC Challenge League 2024/2025 East Asia qualifiers.

The victory not only boosted their confidence but also ensured their place in the next round, even with one match still to play.

The match, held in unfamiliarly near-freezing conditions at MFF Stadium in Ulaanbaatar, saw Brazilian striker Pablo Augusto open the scoring with a penalty kick in the 25th minute, following a foul by SP Falcons’ Batkhishig Myagmar on Japanese player Ryo Fujii. After taking the lead, Svay Rieng had a chance to double their advantage when Augusto missed a golden opportunity, hitting the post with a well-placed shot.

In the second half, the hosts mounted a determined attack. Their persistence paid off in the 67th minute when Daniil Musatkin found the net, levelling the score at 1-1 and reigniting hope for the local team.

However, the tide turned once again the Cambodian Premier League champions. In the 80th minute, Cristian Roque was fouled in the penalty area by Taiyo Toyoda, leading referee Wong Wai Lun to award another penalty to Svay Rieng. Cristian stepped up and converted the penalty, putting his team back in the lead at 2-1.

For the final ten minutes, the Mongolian champions ramped up their assault, desperate to equalise, but they were unable to find the net. Adding to their woes, they lost a player in stoppage time when Matheus Almeida Silva received a red card for injuring Svay Rieng captain Sey Visal.

The loss left SP Falcons and their supporters frustrated, particularly with the referee's decision to award two penalties to Svay Rieng. The defeat dropped them from first to third place in Group E, while Svay Rieng climbed to the top spot with this crucial win, earning three valuable points.

Despite still having one match left against Indonesia’s Madura United, who recently drew 0-0 with the Mongolian side, Svay Rieng's position in the knockout stage is now secure. 

This Saturday’s upcoming clash with the Indonesians will also be critical for the Falcons; a win or draw for Madura would eliminate them, while a loss by more than one goal would see SP Falcons advance alongside Svay Rieng to the knockout stage.

As the teams gear up for their next challenges, the stakes couldn't be higher in this competitive tournament.
