Political stability, economic growth and favourable investment laws have all been cited as factors in Cambodia’s ability to attract investment from more and more multi-national companies. 

This weekend, yet another world-renowned brand will officially establish its presence in Cambodia.

Detroit-based global pizza company Little Caesars has announced that it will officially open its first store in the Kingdom on November 10, when the ribbon is officially cut on a store on Phnom Penh’s Koh Pich.

Hong Vanak, an economist at the Royal Academy of Cambodia, told The Post on November 5 that Cambodia’s economic growth, rising incomes and an increase in international tourists have all attracted more prominent food and restaurant chains, as well as food producers, to do business in the Kingdom. Examples include Burger King, Starbucks, Pizza Hut, Papa Johns, The Pizza Company, KFC and 7-Eleven.

He added that the arrival of these global brands has significantly contributed to the national economy’s growth and demonstrates their confidence in Cambodia's market potential.

“The presence of international companies will also play a role in promoting the Kingdom and attracting more foreign investors and tourists,” suggested Vanak.

The number of international franchise brands entering Cambodia has increased by over 30% in the past five years. This steady growth reflects the country’s attractiveness as an emerging market for global brands.

Sear Rithy, chairman of World Bridge Group, who brought Little Caesars to Cambodia, explained that the Koh Pich venture only marks the beginning of the brand’s expansion into Cambodia, with a second store planned for early next year.

“We are excited to work with a globally renowned brand like Little Caesars to bring new dining options to the people of Cambodia. Our vision is not only to introduce affordable, high-quality pizza but also to contribute to the country’s economic growth through job creation and franchise opportunities,” he added.

According to Rithy, the arrival of the new restaurant chain will create numerous jobs and stimulate the local economy. The first location on Koh Pich will offer employment opportunities for Cambodians, with positions ranging from food preparation to management.

“Cambodia presents a dynamic and rapidly growing market,” added Paula Vissing, president of global retail at Little Caesars.

“With an expanding population and increasing demand for quick-service dining, we are excited to bring Little Caesars affordable and convenient pizzas to Phnom Penh as we expand into our 29th country,” she continued.

The Kingdom’s fast-food industry continues to expand, with consumer spending on quick-service meals rising by 12% over the past three years, according to Euromonitor International. This trend underscores the growing demand for affordable and convenient dining options, making Cambodia an ideal market for Little Caesars, said the company.

A recent report on socio-economic trends from the Ministry of Economy and Finance revealed that, in the first six months of the year, the Council for the Development of Cambodia (CDC) approved 190 investment projects with a total investment capital of $3.258 billion, creating as many as 170,000 new jobs. 

Compared to the same period in 2023, the number of investment projects increased by 62 (68.1%), investment capital rose by 194.7% (equivalent to $2.111 billion), and employment increased by 76% (adding 62,879 jobs).

Little Caesars was founded by Mike and Marian Ilitch in 1959 as a single, family-owned restaurant. Today, it is the third-largest pizza chain in the world, with restaurants in each of the 50 US states and 29 countries and territories, including the Kingdom.
