Prime Minister Hun Manet has reaffirmed the Cambodian government’s commitment to advancing the education sector. He explained that it aims to do so through policies and strategies which improve public education services with efficiency, good governance and accountability to the public and local communities.

As schools across the Kingdom began the new academic year today, the prime minister extended his encouragement for schools to maintain a strong sense of responsibility, especially in teaching and learning activities. 

He emphasised the need for positive educational outcomes, with a focus on instilling discipline, respect and ethics that align with Cambodian values. 

To support this, Manet highlighted several strategic initiatives.

They included continuing education reforms and model school mechanisms, the expansion of after-school programmes to include an additional two hours of core subject study and a strengthened focus in morality and behavioural development.

He underscored the importance of clean, green school environments, free of waste, as spaces that nurture both mental and physical well-being.

He also encouraged teachers to take on roles beyond education, suggesting that they become guides, researchers, advisors and innovators who continuously develop their skills in knowledge and teaching methods, noting that they should integrate information technology and foreign language skills.

Manet called on all relevant ministries, local authorities, communities and other stakeholders to protect children from violence and child labour, and urged widespread awareness about these protections.

He reminded parents and guardians to enrol their children in schools and to offer support and encouragement throughout the 2024-25 academic year.

Minister of Education Hang Chuon Naron, who inaugurated the new school year at Chaktomuk Secondary School, noted the government’s efforts to enhance the education sector. 

He also noted the official implementation of “Model School Standards”, from kindergarten to high school, which began in December 2023.

The minister added that the education ministry has evaluated and awarded prizes to 120 model schools and is currently supporting other institutions to meet model school standards during the 2024-25 school year.

He encouraged all schools to seek out innovative methods and implement new ideas to elevate the quality of human resources within their institutions.
