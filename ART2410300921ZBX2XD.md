In a move to protect citizens from overseas job scams, India has begun displaying digital advisories at major airports, warning travellers about the risks associated with false or misleading employment offers in Cambodia and neighbouring Southeast Asian countries. 

The Embassy of India in Cambodia reports that while they are mindful not to cast the country in a negative light, rising cases of young Indian nationals lured into cybercrime schemes have necessitated visible warnings at immigration checkpoints.

“Stricter checks have been implemented at Indian immigration at airports, which include a display of advisories,” according to the embassy’s statement to _The Post_ on October 29.

"While it is not our intention to depict Cambodia in a poor light, we are obligated to take all possible steps to prevent young Indians from being trapped in cybercrimes and cheating thousands of other Indian nationals of their hard-earned money," it stated. 

The advisories follow a surge in cases of Indian citizens becoming trapped in fraudulent job offers across Southeast Asia.

Many unsuspecting job seekers arrive in Cambodia on tourist visas, responding to unauthorised agents or misleading online advertisements that promise high-paying positions. 

The embassy’s efforts are backed by close cooperation with Cambodian authorities, who have been instrumental in rescuing over 1,000 Indian nationals from scam operations since early 2022. 

With warnings in place and ongoing diplomatic collaboration, India hopes to better shield its citizens from falling into these exploitative schemes abroad.

“The embassy facilitated the rescue and release of just over 1,000 Indian nationals since 2022 until September 30, 2024, with about 770 in the first nine months of 2024 alone,” said the embassy. 

It has reported an alarming rise in cases of Indian nationals becoming victims of job scams across Southeast Asia, with Cambodia identified as a significant location for such fraudulent activities. 

**A regional cybercrime crisis**

The embassy said the issue of job scams has been a growing problem across Indochina and Southeast Asia, where cybercrime syndicates operate complex networks to trap job seekers.

Sources from the embassy reveal that Indian nationals often enter these scams through unauthorised agents or misleading social media ads promising lucrative job opportunities. 

The scam compounds, disguised as legitimate businesses, compel these individuals to engage in cybercrime activities, often by perpetrating fraud on other Indian citizens.

“The embassy has been closely coordinating with Cambodian police in this rescue mission,” said an embassy source, adding that local authorities have been supportive of repatriation efforts. 

“Cambodian police operate a dedicated hotline for reporting cases, which has proven essential for timely interventions. Once rescued, victims are briefly detained to provide statements before they are released and repatriated,” according to the embassy’s statement.

**Increased awareness and preventative measures**

In an attempt to stem this alarming trend, Indian airports have recently installed digital posters warning travellers about job scams in Cambodia, Myanmar and Laos. 

The displays, prominently placed in passenger areas, caution against “fake job offers” and highlight the risk of becoming a “cyber slave”. 

According to India’s _The Hindu_, the Cyber Crime Wing of Tamil Nadu Police and other state authorities have warned that Indians travelling on tourist visas to Southeast Asia are at high risk of falling prey to such schemes. 

"The Indian Cybercrime Coordination Centre reports that 39,735 Indian nationals have travelled to regions like Cambodia, Thailand, Vietnam and Laos on tourist visas under similar circumstances since early 2022, many of whom remain unaccounted for," _The Hindu_ reported.

In addition to these measures, the Indian Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) issued alerts as early as 2022, urging job seekers to verify employers thoroughly and avoid unauthorised agents. 

The notices stress the risks of obtaining employment on tourist visas, as this often contradicts the visa’s intended purpose and may lead to severe consequences abroad.

**Ground-level support and future strategies**

The Indian embassy provides on-the-ground assistance to victims, aiding them with filing police reports, securing travel papers and contacting family members. 

“In many cases, embassy staff have personally overseen repatriation flights, as noted in the recent case where embassy officials helped 67 Indian nationals leave Poipet after being trapped in scam compounds,” said the embassy’s press release issued on October 22. 

Sources within the embassy confirm that they have proposed several strategies to Cambodia’s Ministry of Interior, aiming to create a more structured response to cybercrime. 

The proposal includes establishing a joint task force between Indian and Cambodian law enforcement agencies and scheduling regular meetings with Cambodia’s General Commissariat of National Police. 

Additionally, the Indian Cybercrime Coordination Centre has suggested a collaborative framework to curb cybercrime and human trafficking, strengthening the bond between both nations’ cybersecurity departments.

Despite efforts to seek comment regarding the digital posters that place Cambodia at the top of the list alongside Myanmar and Laos, _The Post_ was unable to reach a spokesperson from Cambodia’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation for comment on the developments.

Cambodian ambassador to India Koy Kuong, who recently completed his mandate, could not comment on the matter.

**Personal stories highlight the human impact of cybercrime**

Behind the statistics are numerous harrowing stories of individuals deceived by trusted acquaintances or fake agents.

For instance, _Business Standard_ shared an account of seven young men from Maniyoor, who were promised lucrative jobs and coerced into paying high fees for visas. 

“Upon arrival in Cambodia, they found themselves trapped, subjected to physical abuse and forced into illegal activities,” said the outlet. 

Their ordeal underscores the brutal conditions many victims face before seeking aid from Indian authorities.

Following a major police operation in Odisha last December, Indian law enforcement arrested several individuals linked to trafficking networks that allegedly sent people to Cambodia. 

**India’s commitment to combatting cybercrime**

The MEA has reiterated that while it has no intention of casting Cambodia in a negative light, it is crucial to protect Indian citizens from the growing threat of cybercrime. 

“An estimated 500 crore \[approximately $60 million\] has been defrauded from Indian citizens in the past six months due to scams linked to cyber syndicates in Cambodia and neighbouring regions,” according to _Business Standard_. 

Instances of exploitation through fake work abroad scams have been reported in various regions, including East European and Central Asian countries, certain Gulf countries, Israel, Canada, Myanmar and Laos, according to the MEA.

Indian citizens are encouraged to report fraudulent agents and syndicates, with the Indian embassy helping facilitate complaints through India’s First Information Report (FIR) system. 

These actions provide victims with a legal pathway to justice and seek to curb the activities of fraudulent agents operating in both countries.

**Advisories and regional warnings**

The MEA’s advisories, continuously updated to address new tactics used by these syndicates, urge job seekers to look for employment opportunities only through authorised channels. 

Cambodian authorities, in turn, have assured their commitment to assisting the embassy in rescue missions and supporting regional cybersecurity initiatives. 

The embassy’s outreach, combined with digital warnings at Indian airports, marks a shift toward preventative measures that aim to safeguard job seekers before they fall victim to such schemes.

As of now, the Indian embassy remains vigilant, working closely with Cambodian law enforcement and urging Indian nationals to exercise caution. 

“Victims or their families are advised to contact the Indian embassy via the emergency hotline in Phnom Penh, where officials stand ready to assist,” said the embassy. 

Its response underscores the need for a global approach to counter cybercrime and protect vulnerable job seekers. 

The Indian government’s sustained efforts reflect a commitment to regional cooperation, aiming to close loopholes that allow cyber syndicates to exploit unsuspecting individuals across borders.
