# Danone Cambodia Highlights B Corp as Sustainable Commitment through EuroCham Green Business Forum

Danone Specialized Nutrition Cambodia (Danone Cambodia), a subsidiary of the number one nutrition company in Europe, is collaborating with EuroCham Cambodia’s Green Business Forum 2024 to emphasise its commitment to the green economy and sustainability, in alignment with the global sustainable development goals (SDGs).

The Green Business Forum 2024, organised by the Green Business Committee of EuroCham Cambodia, gathers a diverse group of stakeholders. These include policymakers, industry leaders, businesses, experts and representatives from local and international organisations and institutions such as the UNDP, IFC and the EU. The forum aims to discuss green business practices and sustainable economic development and foster partnerships.

In November 2023, Danone Cambodia became the first Cambodia-based FMCG brand to receive a B Corp™ certification. This recognition highlights the company’s commitment to being a “force for good”. Achieving the B corp certification has motivated Danone Cambodia to uphold its high standards by building stronger relationships with local communities, enhancing social and environmental impact and fostering a culture of sustainability within the organisation.

Speaking at the Green Business Forum, Danone Cambodia’s Country Director Maarten Van Leeuwen said: “Our support of this valuable forum stems from our dedication to sustainable business practices and environmental preservation. As a recognised B Corp™ company, we take our sustainability and ‘green business’ obligations very seriously, alongside our employees and social impact commitments. Danone Cambodia is proud to be acknowledged for our commitment to sustainability as well as our dedication to our people – through our HR initiatives and engagement with local communities in which we operate.”

Tan Ee Beng, Director of B Market Builder (BMB) SEA, the appointed network partner of B Lab in Southeast Asia said, “As a proud instigator of the B Corp™ certification, we at BMB SEA are always ready and willing to support events and initiatives that encourage companies to raise their standards of social and environmental performance, transparency and accountability. The Green Business Forum promotes principles that align with our collective vision at B Lab – to create a more inclusive, equitable and regenerative economy for all.”

In a bid to encourage other Cambodian companies to apply for B Lab’s B Corp™ certification, Danone Cambodia presented a case study highlighting our milestones and the rigorous standards we have met to earn our B Corp™ certification. The global B Corp™ certification indicates that the certified organisations voluntarily meet certain standards of transparency, accountability, sustainability and performance, with an aim to create value for society.

Key topics at this year’s Green Business Forum included discussions on harnessing Cambodia's potential for reducing the carbon footprint while exploring new business models, opportunities for public and private sector financing of green business initiatives, integrating corporate social responsibility (CSR) into core business strategies to align with sustainability goals and preparing Cambodia’s workforce for the future of green industries.
