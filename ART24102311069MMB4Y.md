The Ministry of National Defence has officially banned the leasing of vehicles with military license plates to companies or private individuals, as well as their use on vehicles other than those they were originally assigned to.

The directive was announced in a public notice issued by the ministry’s General Department of Technical Equipment on October 21, in line with recent recommendations from Prime Minister Hun Manet.

The measure seeks to improve discipline and adherence to road traffic laws, aiming to prevent the misuse of military plates that could jeopardise public safety. Concerns such as traffic accidents and improper behaviour by certain users have drawn public criticism, tarnishing the reputation of the Cambodian Armed Forces.

"Military license plates should only be used by military officers of the Royal Cambodian Armed Forces and for their intended purpose," the notice stated.

The notice also emphasised that civilians and foreign nationals are prohibited from using vehicles with military plates. The same restrictions apply to companies collaborating with the defence sector.

Any violations of the directive will result in legal action being taken by the department. Authorised military personnel must comply with traffic laws, and any improper use of military plates will lead to their confiscation and return to the department.

The directive further states that vehicles belonging to retired officers who have passed away or become disabled are no longer allowed to use military plates, and they will be confiscated and stored at the department.

The General Department of Technical Material also clarified the types of vehicles eligible for military plates. These include vehicles provided by the state, ones donated from foreign countries or philanthropists for military use, state-owned vehicles that are no longer in service and need reappropriation, as well as vehicles obtained through court decisions or those that have already fulfilled their import taxes and other duties.

Kim Panga, country director of the Asia Injury Prevention (AIP) Foundation, voiced support for the new measures, stating that the use of military plates should serve the institution and society.

"If the plates are misused, it harms the interests of the military unit and our national interests. From a public perspective, it also undermines trust in the institution," he said.

Regarding the use of military, police or state license plates, Panga also called for regular monitoring and evaluation within units every three to six months or randomly, in coordination with the traffic police.

He suggested that a public hotline be set up for citizens to offer constructive feedback for review and corrective measures.

He further recommended studying the feasibility of creating policies or internal regulations within the ministry to promote traffic safety.

He said these regulations should outline the dos and don'ts for drivers, officials and ministry staff, particularly when using vehicles with military plates.

Traffic safety remains a significant concern in Cambodia, Panga noted, urging other relevant ministries to assign key personnel to plan and implement initiatives that promote lawfulness among soldiers, officers, police and other government officials.

Last week, the National Police removed nearly 2,000 vehicles from the police license plate management list, following the prime minister’s directive to tighten control over the use of military and police plates.
