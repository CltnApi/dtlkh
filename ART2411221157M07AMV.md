UNICEF brought children and youth, authorities, representatives of civil society organisations and even celebrities together to celebrate World Children’s Day on November 22. 

The festivities, held in the northeast province of Mondulkiri, also mark the anniversary of the Kingdom’s 1992 adoption of the Convention on the Rights of the Child.

This year, the organisation aims to continue amplifying the voices of children and young people as advocates for children’s rights in the country. 

The occasion also marked day one of Bonn Phum on the Move, a youth-led, three-day event focused on climate adaptation and environmental preservation, which was co-organised with non-profit youth led arts collective Plerng Kob.

“We are here in Mondulkiri to celebrate the promise of children and youth in Cambodia,” said Will Parks, UNICEF representative in Cambodia, at the World Children’s Day celebrations, held at Pulung Primary School, with the deputy provincial governor Cheak Mengheang in attendance.

“However, today also serves as a reminder of the profound challenges facing children in remote areas, who are disproportionately deprived of access to essential services and increasingly vulnerable to the devastating and life-threatening impacts of climate change,” he noted.

A November 22 press release from UNICEF cautioned that despite Cambodia’s impressive achievements in implementing the Convention of the Rights of the Child over the past decades, challenges persist, particularly in remote regions such as Mondulkiri. Many children in this province face significant inequalities and multiple deprivations.

“Close to one-third (29 per cent) of children under five are stunted, and approximately one in ten (11 per cent) children in Mondulkiri have not received any vaccines, which is 3 per cent above the national average. Alarmingly, one-third of women aged 20–24 were married before they turned 18, also the second-highest rate in the country,” it said.

It also warned of the unpredictable climate and environmental threats faced by the children of the province.

“According to the recent Children’s Climate and Environmental Risk Index (CCRI) for Cambodia, 92 per cent of the population under 18 is highly or very highly vulnerable to climate and environmental hazards, shocks, and stresses because they have limited access to essential social services,” added the release.

Over the course of the three-day festival, more than 100 volunteers will lead activities at the Bunong Indigenous village. Youth, including those from ethnic minorities, will conduct workshops on child rights, climate adaptation, mental health, nutrition and other essential life skills. 

The statement detailed how on Saturday, 23 November, prominent artists like Chacha, Roxy, Jany, Peak Mi, Mengkeo Pichenda, Kesorr, Suzana Yubin Shin, and other celebrities will perform in Senmorom town to celebrate child rights and inspire young people.

“While we mark this day with humility, I also want to share a message of hope. By empowering young people and children to lead and take action against the issues that impact their lives, their communities and their futures, we all benefit from their tremendous potential as drivers of social change,” said Parks.

“On this World Children’s Day, let us all be inspired by these young leaders as we work together to build a healthier, more resilient future for Cambodia and its children,” he added.

UNICEF explained the vital role of multilingual education in the province, where indigenous communities represent a significant part of the population. Multilingual programmes ensure that children gain foundational literacy, while maintaining their unique cultural identity.

“World Children's Day is a day for children like me who commemorate the rights of all children, including the right to education, growth and care,” said Phea Mani, a Grade 6 student at Pulung Primary School.

“I am glad that my school taught me both my native language and Khmer. Teachers have bilingual lessons that help me and all my friends know our language and Khmer. This learning helps us read, write, and listen well,” added the student.
