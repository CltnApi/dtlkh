A senior official has identified economic diplomacy as essential in the coming year, sharing his belief that 2025 will bring heightened global turbulence. 

While addressing a November 18 press conference to review the progress of the seventh-mandate government after its first 15 months in office, Jean-Francois Tain, Minister Delegate attached to the Prime Minister in charge of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation, highlighted the economic and trade challenges that lie ahead, particularly with the return of Donald Trump to the US presidency. 

“2024 is a historic turning point. This year, many major countries around the world have held elections, including India, Europe, Russia and the US. In Europe, there is also a trend showing the rise of extreme right-wing or left-wing groups. These radical groups are turning their backs on the world and focusing only on the interests of their respective nations,” he said.

“According to several experts, the world may face even greater turmoil in 2025. Geopolitical tensions will not benefit the global economy, leading to continued economic stagnation and possible social unrest in some regions,” he added.

Tain explained that for Cambodia to address these challenges, economic diplomacy – promoting the country’s investment potential and tourism – is essential. He noted that this approach would help Cambodia achieve its vision of becoming an upper-middle-income country by 2030 and a high-income country by 2050.  

He also emphasised that Prime Minister Hun Manet consistently highlights the conducive investment environment in Cambodia, marked by safety, peace, macroeconomic stability and favourable investment laws, all key factors for driving growth.

In the context of economic diplomacy, Tain also encouraged Cambodians to leverage social media platforms to enhance the Kingdom’s image, especially its tourism sector, as the country strives to attract international arrival figures back to pre-Covid-19 levels of over 6.6 million per annum. 

“Everyone has the responsibility to use Facebook, TikTok, Instagram and other social media platforms to promote the government’s economic diplomacy and showcase the beauty of Cambodia,” he said. 

Government spokesperson Pen Bona also addressed the press conference. He noted that transforming Cambodia into a high-income country by 2050 is an unwavering goal that must be safeguarded by peace.

“This direction cannot be hindered by anyone,” he said.
