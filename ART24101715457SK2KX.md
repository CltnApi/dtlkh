# Cambodia set for 5.8% growth in 2024; inflation forecast lowered: ADB

Inflation projections have been lowered to 0.5 per cent due to slow food price increases and declining fuel costs.

The Asian Development Bank (ADB) has maintained its growth forecast for Cambodia at 5.8 per cent for 2024 and 6.0 per cent for 2025.

It has revised down its earlier inflation projection for 2024 from 2.0 per cent to 0.5 per cent, reflecting the slow increase in food prices and decline in fuel prices in the first half of 2024, according to the Asian Development Outlook (ADO) September 2024.

“The rebound in the manufacturing sector—especially garments, footwear, and travel goods (GFT) —is powering the country’s economic growth,” said ADB Country Director for Cambodia Jyotsana Varma.
