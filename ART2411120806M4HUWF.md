Young goalkeeper Saveng Samnang of Phnom Penh Crown FC has been called up to the Cambodian national football squad for the second time, after a four-year absence. 

Along with Samnang, forward Ky Rina and defender Sor Rotana have also been invited to join the Kouprey for a November 12 to 17 training camp in Qatar.

Samnang replaces Visakha FC's number one goalkeeper Hul Kimhuy, while the first-choice goalkeepers Preah Khan Reach Svay Rieng FC, Vireak Dara, and Nagaworld FC, Reth Lyheng, remain in the squad, under the guidance of Japanese head coach Koji Gyotoku.

Samnang's return to the national team comes as a result of his recent outstanding performances. He has impressed with his ball-saving ability, particularly after national team regular Um Vichet sustained an injury. 

Samnang's contributions have also been crucial in helping Phnom Penh Crown maintain an undefeated record in the 2024 Cambodian Premier League (CPL), with 10 wins and one draw, placing them top of the league with 31 points, six points clear of second-placed Visakha FC.

However, competition for a starting spot with the national team will be fierce for the 25-year-old, who has only previously made appearances with the senior team in the 2020-2021 season, during Cambodia's tour of Afghanistan.

Despite this, Samnang is excited about his second call-up and the opportunity to prove himself. He acknowledged that competing for a spot with experienced players like Vireak Dara will be tough, particularly given Dara’s physicality and experience. 

However, Samnang is determined to give his best in training and matches to show his abilities to coach Koji.

In addition to Samnang, forward Ky Rina, who has impressed with Siem Reap-based club Angkor Tiger FC, helping them to reach the Top 4 in the 2024-2025 CPL, has also been recalled to the national team after a period of absence. Similarly, young forward Sor Rotana from Visakha FC is also back in the squad.

The 20 other players called up to the national team for this training camp include notable names such as Sieng Chanthea, Taing Bunchhai (both from Boeung Ket FC), Yudai Ogawa, Orn Chanpolin, Seut Baraing, Yeu Muslim and Lim Pisoth (all from Phnom Penh Crown FC). 

Other players include Nhean Sosidan, Hikaru Mizuno, Soeu Visal, Saret Kya, Taylor Deung Nicolas, Kim Sokyuth and Min Ratanak (from Preah Khan Reach Svay Rieng FC), as well as Mo Kan, Sa Ty, Leng Nora (from Visakha FC) and attacking midfielder Sos Suhana (from Nagaworld FC).

The  team will use the Qatar training camp in Qatar to prepare for upcoming international friendlies and the 2024 ASEAN Championship, which will take place from December 8 to 20. Cambodia is in Group A alongside Thailand, Malaysia, Singapore and Timor-Leste, while Group B features Vietnam, Indonesia, Myanmar, the Philippines and Laos.

In recent international friendlies, Cambodia, under newly-appointed coach Koji, defeated Chinese Taipei 3-2 at the Olympic Stadium on October 11, but lost 3-0 to Hong Kong in a friendly on October 15. Despite these mixed results, the team is focused on preparing for the ASEAN Championship and will continue to build on their performances in Qatar.
