Cambodia's increasing military ties with China, including the recent docking of Chinese warships, have sparked concerns about US influence in the region, the stability of the South China Sea, and Cambodia's neutrality within ASEAN.

Recent developments in Cambodia’s military cooperation with China, including the docking of Chinese warships, have raised concerns among regional experts and the United States (US), centering on the potential impact on US interests in the region, the stability of the South China Sea, and Cambodia’s position within ASEAN.

China has sent two warships to Cambodia at the Kingdom’s request, aimed at strengthening Cambodia’s capacity to maintain peace, stability and security, as well as support rescue operations and humanitarian activities at sea, according to the National Defense Ministry.

Sophal Ear, associate professor at Thunderbird School of Global Management at Arizona State University, said on Tuesday, September 10, Chinese warships in Cambodia could counterbalance US influence, potentially escalating tensions in the South China Sea and impacting regional stability.
