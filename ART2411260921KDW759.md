Experts in civil aviation, tourism and transportation assert that Techo International Airport (TIA), located near Phnom Penh, will significantly bolster Cambodia's economic growth by improving access for tourists, investors and cargo.

The facility is more than 90% complete, with over $1.3 billion spent so far.

Situated in Kandal and Takeo provinces, about 20 kilometres south of the nation’s capital, the airport is being constructed on 2,600 hectares of land through a joint investment by the Cambodian government and the Overseas Cambodian Investment Corporation (OCIC). Classified as a Category 4F airport, it will accommodate the world's largest aircraft, including the Boeing 747-800 and Airbus A380-800.

TIA’s construction is divided into three phases. The first includes a four-kilometre runway designed to handle large 4F category aircraft, with a capacity to serve over 15 million passengers annually by 2030. Phase two will introduce two additional runways, raising passenger capacity to 30 million annually by 2050. The third phase will add a third runway, enabling the facility to manage up to 45 million passengers annually starting in 2050.

**Smooth progress**

On November 26, Sinn Chanserey Vutha, spokesperson for the State Secretariat of Civil Aviation (SSCA), told _The Post_ that construction of the airport is progressing smoothly, with over 90% completion as of November 5.

He said the total expenditure thus far is approximately $1.3 billion of the $1.5 billion investment planned for phase one. 

He also noted that air traffic in the country is expected to increase by 10-20% in 2024 compared to 2023.

Chanserey Vutha highlighted that the aviation sector will experience significant improvement once the airport becomes operational. He noted that the modern facility is designed to accommodate large aircraft and features international-standard passenger terminals and cargo warehouses.

He stated, “TIA will become a key player in boosting the Cambodian aviation sector and attracting more international transport that has not yet been accessible to Cambodia.”

The government is actively promoting the country’s transportation and tourism potential, signing several memoranda of understanding (MoUs) with governments and companies worldwide to attract more foreign visitors and investors.

He remarked, “Nevertheless, Cambodia must continue to strengthen its air transport services.”

According to the SSCA, major construction works for TIA are expected to conclude by the end of 2024. If plans remain unchanged, the airport is scheduled to officially open in mid-2025. Currently, more than 15,000 workers, including engineers and managers, are engaged in the project, 90% of whom are Cambodian nationals.

**Enhanced tourist accessibility**

Thourn Sinan, president of the Pacific-Asia Tourism Association (PATA) Cambodia chapter, remarked that the progress of the construction represents a significant advancement for the country’s tourism sector. 

He noted that the new airport is larger and more modern than the existing Phnom Penh International Airport (PNH). With its completion, Cambodia is expected to attract more international airlines, particularly if the global geopolitical climate improves.

He stated, “Once the new airport becomes operational, it will attract the attention of major international airlines to Cambodia, and more flights will come to the country.”

However, Sinan emphasised that attracting international airlines also depends on government policies in the tourism sector, including visa facilitation, the conduct of airport staff and the management of foreign nationals, some of whom are causing issues that could negatively impact international perceptions of the country.

According to the Ministry of Tourism, Cambodia welcomed 4.8 million international tourists in the first three quarters of 2024, marking a 22.2% increase compared to the same period in 2023. In 2019, the tourism sector reached its peak, with 6.61 million tourists generating $4.92 billion in revenue, contributing approximately 12.1% of Cambodia's GDP.

**Fresh agriculture exports to drive cargo surge**

Sin Chanthy, president of the Cambodia Logistics Association (CLA), stated that the opening of TIA will bring significant economic benefits, particularly in the transportation sector.

He said the new airport is expected to enhance the country’s connectivity to distant markets and boost its tourism sector, playing a vital role in accelerating the country’s economic growth.

He highlighted the government’s consistent efforts to introduce policies aimed at developing the transport sector, which is crucial for attracting investors and tourists.

Additionally, he said these policies contribute to lowering the cost of Cambodian goods, enabling these products to compete more effectively in international markets.

Chanthy asserted, “I am confident that TIA will drive Cambodia's economic growth because when the air transport sector grows, the export of goods, especially agricultural products, will increase. For instance, our neighbouring countries often use air transport to export fresh agricultural products to international markets. Direct export of \[such\] products will help Cambodia earn more revenue than selling to nearby countries for re-export.”

Chea Chandara, president of the Logistics and Supply Chain Business Association in Cambodia (LOSCBA), added that the new airport will undoubtedly increase air travel and the number of large aircraft arriving in the country. He noted that as transportation activity rises, shipping costs will decrease.

He remarked, “The number of flights from distant countries using large aircraft to Cambodia will grow, and the transport of goods and passengers will increase.”

According to the General Department of Customs and Excise (GDCE), total trade between Cambodia and its partners reached $45.06 billion from January to October, reflecting a 16.5% increase compared to the same period in 2023, which was $38.67 billion. Cambodia's exports amounted to $21.57 billion, a 16% increase from $18.59 billion, while imports totalled $23.49 billion, a 16.5% increase from $20.07 billion.
