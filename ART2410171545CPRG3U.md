# LOLC Cambodia Strengthening Financial Literacy Awareness Efforts

LOLC Cambodia, one of the Kingdom’s leading microfinance institutions, is proud to announce the results of its financial literacy training and community outreach initiatives for 2024. As part of the company’s continued mission to support sustainable economic growth and financial empowerment, LOLC has made impressive progress this year.

From January to September 2024 alone, the institution conducted 261 training sessions, benefitting 5,151 participants, 3,763 of them women. These efforts reflect LOLC’s dedication to financial inclusion and community development as it moves forward into the next phase of its social responsibility initiatives.

Beyond face-to-face training, LOLC also leverages its social media platforms to further educate a wider audience on essential financial topics. Through engaging content on managing personal finances, understanding debt and saving for the future, LOLC ensures that financial knowledge is accessible to people of all ages and in every region, including rural communities. 

This strategic use of digital platforms complements its in-person training programmes and amplifies the reach of its financial literacy mission.

In addition, LOLC launched the _Financial Literacy Short Story Writing Contest_ in 2024.

The competition encouraged people to share their personal experiences and the lessons they have learned about financial management. The contest received an overwhelming response from the public, with the two winning stories selected and transformed into short films.

These films resonated with a broad audience, presenting relatable financial challenges and solutions in an engaging and creative format. This initiative not only promoted financial literacy but also gave individuals a platform to share their stories and inspire others.

 “Financial literacy is more than just knowledge – it’s about giving individuals the tools they need to secure their futures. At LOLC, we are proud to have touched the lives of so many in 2023, and now in 2024, we’ve expanded our reach to even more Cambodians,” said Mr. Sok Voeun, CEO of LOLC.

“Through our training sessions, social media campaigns and storytelling initiatives, our goal remains clear: to empower as many people as possible through financial education,” he added.

LOLC is well on track to exceed the positive impact it had last year, with 261 training courses completed in the first nine months of this year, and plans to expand even further in the coming months.

This year, the institution will introduce new topics which integrate financial technologies (fintech) and digital banking, crucial skills for staying competitive in an increasingly digital economy.

Looking ahead, LOLC is committed to scaling its efforts even further. 

Mr. Sok Voeun shared the company’s plans for the future, as he reflected on its continued community engagement.

”We believe that our mission is not only about delivering financial services but also about making a positive impact in each of the communities we serve. In 2024, we have already reached more people than ever before through our financial literacy programmes, and we will continue to push the boundaries of our outreach,” he noted.

“Our focus is on ensuring that Cambodians, especially those in rural areas, have the knowledge and tools to manage their finances successfully. Additionally, we aim to deepen our environmental and social initiatives to support sustainable development,” he added.

LOLC Cambodia’s commitment to financial education and community engagement remains stronger than ever. As the institution leads the way with its innovative approach to financial literacy – combining in-person training, social media content and creative storytelling – it is proud of the number of Cambodians across the Kingdom who are now better equipped to manage their finances and build brighter futures.
