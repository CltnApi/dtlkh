# How Mongolian rap gave this Cambodian gin brand its big break

A single bottled cocktail served at a wedding led to the biggest order Cambodian gin brand Seekers has ever received. And then, a hip-hop track. Nimmi Malhotra reports.

Cambodia and Mongolia are in the furthest recesses of the Asian marketing strategy for most brands. Still, the two countries are doing boisterous business with each other, thanks to one wedding and a boozy wedding favour: Seekers Spirits RTD cocktail Flying Bong.

Seekers Spirits, founded by husband-and-wife team Marco Julia Eggert and Tania Unsworth, is a craft spirits company based in Phnom Penh, Cambodia. The sustainable brand uses native botanicals like Khmer basil, Battambang green oranges and Asian lime leaf sourced from the Mekong Delta for its core gin products. Today, its gin portfolio – which includes Mekong Dry Gin and the colour-changing blue pea Jason Kong gin – is one of Cambodia’s top five gin brands in the country, ranking among the likes of Diageo’s Gordon’s and Bacardi’s Bombay Sapphire.
