More than 200 community members, as well as monks, government officials and representatives of civil society organisations gathered in Kratie province today to celebrate last week’s October 24 International Freshwater Dolphin Day. The day aims to raise awareness about the significance of dolphin conservation amid the threats posed by illegal fishing.

This annual event for Mekong dolphins was jointly organised by WWF Cambodia (WWF), the Fisheries Administration under the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries, and the Kratie Provincial Administration. The ceremony took place at the Kampi river guard post in Kampi village, of Chet Borey district’s Sambok commune.

The WWF explained that the purpose of the event was to “raise public awareness on the importance of dolphins and relevant legal standards, especially fisheries law”. Additionally, it aimed to “highlight the importance of dolphin conservation, aquatic resources, ecosystems and the relationship between dolphin preservation, tourism development and the livelihoods of local communities”.

According to the agriculture ministry, the number of Mekong dolphins in Cambodia was 105 as of a June 2024 survey, including eight new calves. However, three dolphins have died, including a young female in August near the Kampi Pool, due to becoming entangled in fishing nets.

The Mekong dolphin is one of 58 endangered aquatic species listed in a government sub-decree and is also classified as critically endangered on the IUCN Red List.

The WWF highlighted that in 2020, the Mekong population was just 89. 

“Ongoing threats to this limited population include the use of fishing nets and hooks in core habitats, and electric shock fishing,” it stated.

If protection and proper management are not in place, dolphin numbers may decline, leading to their potential extinction in the Mekong. 

The WWF appealed to the public via social media, saying, “We must work together to protect and conserve dolphins for sustainable tourism. More dolphins mean more tourism and better livelihoods”.

The event featured a procession of monks and dolphin-related art created by young students.

The students shared an important message.

“Together, we can stop all types of fishing in dolphin pools. Stop using electric shock equipment and restore fish stocks. Together, we will protect dolphins and all fish species,” they said.

In support of this conservation effort, the agriculture ministry signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with the WWF on October 30, outlining a five-year collaboration focusing on sustainable development initiatives, such as fisheries and forest community development and agricultural and agro-forestry expansion.

Agriculture minister Dith Tina expressed his appreciation for the rising numbers of dolphins, which he considered national treasures. In 2023 and 2024, the ministry collaborated with WWF and other partners to protect dolphins through more effective patrols and crime prevention, marking a significant success for the ministry, according to the agriculture ministry.

“The ministry needs partners with clear shared goals, genuine expertise and a mutual commitment to achieve positive outcome,” said Tina.

He encouraged the proactive implementation of the MoU to produce tangible results, jointly address challenges and achieve mutual successes.
