# As Prahok season approaches, fishers urged to keep eye out for endangered species

The Stung Treng provincial Fisheries Administration (FiA) recently celebrated the release of several rare species that were inadvertently caught by community members in the province. FiA

Ahead of the upcoming prahok fishing season, the Fisheries Administration (FiA) of the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry, and Fisheries has urged fisherman to immediately release any examples of endangered species that they catch. They should also notify officials as soon as possible.

According to the FiA, endangered species include fish such as the giant barb, Aasean bonytongue, thicklip barb, giant stingray, narrow barred tigerperch, giant salmon carp, as well as other rare species.

The administration issued instructions to those using drag nets in Phnom Penh and Kandal province, as well as local fishermen working in rivers, lakes, streams and canals.

“If a rare species is caught, they must inform officials in order to return the fish to their natural habitats. This will replenish fish stocks and ensure the sustainability of aquatic resources,” it said.

Ouk Vibol, head of the Fisheries Conservation Department, explained that there are 58 endangered species of fish listed in the government’s Sub-Decree No. 123, issued in 2009. Of them, half are freshwater species and half are saltwater species. 

He noted that since 2009, the FiA has printed posters of the different species, distributing them across the Kingdom, in order to educate local residents and promote conservation efforts.

“Drag fishing net fishing mainly catches prahok fish that come from the Tonle Sap River. However, some prohibited species are also caught. It is important that people do not hide or trade these fish. If caught, they should be released. We encourage and commend those who do so,” he said. 

“This written appeal is particularly significant for those fishing for prahok fish during November and December, as many fish are caught during this period. We urge them to be cautious and contact us or release the fish back into the water, as these species are nearing extinction,” he added.

Vibol expressed confidence that public education and awareness efforts have been sufficient so far. He explained that under the law, trading in these fish species is punishable by fines, with penalties up to three times the market value of the fish.

Recently, at least four narrow barred tigerperch and thicklip barb were released back into natural waters by the community and FiA officials in Stung Treng province after being caught, according to the Stung Treng FiA.

“Releasing these fish is an exemplary and invaluable act that contributes to the preservation, protection and conservation of endangered fish species and key breeding fish, ensuring their continued presence in natural waters for future generations,” it stated.

The FiA encourages all citizens to participate in the protection, preservation and conservation of these valuable natural resources.
