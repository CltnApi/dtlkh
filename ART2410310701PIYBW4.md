“_Black Water_”, a powerful new creation by the acclaimed dance troupe SilverBelle, invites audiences to reflect on the toxic legacies of power and control that permeate both our bodies and our cities. 

Through an evocative blend of movement and narrative, the performance challenges prevailing notions of masculinity and the environmental degradation we inflict upon our planet, explained the organisers.

The choreography was described as “a poignant examination of how societal toxins manifest in individual lives, ultimately seeking purification and enlightenment.”

The performance draws from rich cultural narratives, weaving together elements of legend and history. 

The creators reference the story of Buddha, who, while meditating under the Bodhi tree, was beset by demons attempting to thwart his quest for enlightenment. 

It was the earth goddess Preah Mae Thorani who intervened, by “washing away his demons towards enlightenment”. This myth serves as a metaphor for the struggles against internal and external oppression.

“Stretching down his right hand, he touched the earth and summoned her to be his witness. Twisting her long hair, she then created the floods of water, washing away his demons towards enlightenment,” they explained.

Acclaimed dancers Chumvan Sodhachivy (aka choreographer “Belle”), Chhun Baramey and Miguel Jeronimo bring SilverBelle’s vision to life, supported by a few surprise guests. 

Their movements, set against a stark black backdrop, symbolise the deep contrasts between the suffocating weight of societal norms and the liberating potential of self-acknowledgment. 

The dark stage serves as a canvas for their artistry, enhancing the visual impact of the choreography while echoing the themes of darkness and light inherent in the performance.

“I'm joining this dance performance in collaboration with the choreographer Belle, who mixes traditional Apsara and contemporary dance," Jeronimo told _The Post_. 

"_Black Water_" also delves into familiar narratives, such as that of Ram and Sita from the Ramayana. 

The performance touches on themes of trust and betrayal, exemplified in Ram’s forced trial of Sita, illustrating the destructive nature of patriarchal control. 

The organisers highlight that “despite her love, he was filled with distrust,” leading to dire consequences for both characters. 

The retelling invites viewers to consider the contemporary relevance of these ancient stories, urging us to confront our present-day relationships with power and agency.

The piece promises to be a groundbreaking performance that fuses dance with a profound message about gender relations and the environment.
