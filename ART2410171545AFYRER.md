A carbon credit scheme in Cambodia put on hold after allegations of rights abuses has been reinstated after more than a year of review, a verification body said.

The Southern Cardamom REDD+ project was halted after a Human Rights Watch (HRW) report alleged forced evictions and harassment of residents living near the forest protected by the scheme.

The project of over 450,000 hectares generated carbon credits — bought by companies to offset emissions — by protecting forest it said would otherwise have been cut down.
