The Ministry of Women’s Affairs, in partnership with the UN Population Fund (UNFPA) and funded by the Wesley Zaidan Japan organisation, officially launched the “GBV Safe App” on November 25.

The launch of the new app – a groundbreaking initiative to combat gender-based violence (GBV) across Cambodia – coincides with the start of the “16 Days of Activism against Gender-Based Violence” campaign.

A joint statement from the ministry, UNFPA and the Japanese organisation explained that the app is an 

important advancement in the Kingdom’s efforts to provide those that experience violence easy access to information, support and care. 

The app provides easy access to essential information, raising awareness about GBV and sexual harassment, while educating users on their rights and available support services.

According to the release, it also links users to a network of essential services, including hotlines, legal aid and psychosocial counselling. In addition, it offers direct calling to emergency services, with future versions to include live location sharing.

“The GBV Safe App is a testament to our commitment to leverage technology to combat gender-based violence,” Ing Kantha Phavi, Minister of Women’s Affairs.

“This app provides women and girls with information and resources to seek help when they need it most. It is a crucial step towards creating a safer and more equitable society for all,” she added.

The free app is currently available on Android devices via the Google Play Store and will soon be available on the Apple App Store. Registration requires minimal information for user privacy.

Sandra Bernklau, UNFPA representative, emphasised the importance of partnerships in addressing GBV.

“The development of the GBV Safe App was not possible without partnerships. By joining forces, we and other partners have created a tool that can make a real difference in the lives of women and girls in Cambodia,” she said.

Hikari Kokai Chang, Wesley Zaidan representative, highlighted the organisation's dedication to supporting initiatives that promote the safety and well-being of women and girls. 

“We are proud to partner with the ministry and UNFPA on this vital project. The GBV Safe App is an innovative solution that harnesses the power of technology to address a critical issue,” she explained.

According to the release, the app aligns with the country's commitments to the International Conference on Population and Development (ICPD) and the National Action Plan to Prevent Violence Against Women (NAPVAW). 

The ministry, UNFPA, and Wesley Zaidan encouraged all stakeholders, including government ministries, civil society organisations, the private sector and the media, to promote the GBV Safe App and support its widespread adoption.
