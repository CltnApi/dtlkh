Tiger® Beer has become the Official Beer Partner of Manchester United, one of the most popular and successful sports teams in the world. The iconic Asian brewer aims to enhance experiences and deepen engagement with United fans globally.

The partnership launches at an exciting moment in Tiger® Beer's bold brand evolution, heralding a new era for the company and its football-loving consumers. 

In its initial stage, the partnership will focus on connecting with the large Manchester United supporter base in Asia, where Tiger is one of the premium beers in Asia among consumers, providing an unparalleled platform to activate the partnership.

As part of its plans to deepen connections with their favourite club, Tiger Beer conducted a survey of 2,000 football fans across Asia. The results revealed that 70% of supporters say fan engagement activities are essential deepening their connection with their chosen club, 69% believe fan related activities are vital to bringing supporters together and 95% expressed the belief that football has the capability to unite and build long-lasting community bonds. 

In line with the insights provided by the survey, Tiger Beer and Southeast Asia’s #1 football team, Manchester United, are committed to delivering a deeper connection with fans by delivering exciting activations such as branded watch parties, opportunities to win prizes to connect with the club in Manchester, as well as bringing a first-of-its-kind street football event to the Asia region – providing local talent with training and mentorship advice from coaches and club legends from Manchester United. 

Sean O'Donnell, Global Brand Director of Tiger® Beer, expressed his excitement: “We are thrilled to announce our partnership with Manchester United, a club that shares our passion for creating unforgettable moments and connecting fans worldwide. At Tiger, we believe that when we uncage our inner Tiger and roar together with our tribe, we unlock the potential for great things. This partnership with Manchester United reflects our shared belief that progress is driven by collective strength and courage. As we prepare to reveal an exciting new chapter for Tiger in the upcoming weeks, we are excited to bring the electrifying energy of matchday at Old Trafford to fans all around the world.”

“Tiger® Beer's dedication to connecting fans globally aligns perfectly with our goal to bring our fanbase closer to the club than ever before. Together, leveraging the power and reach of Tiger Beer, we look forward to creating unique and unforgettable experiences for our fans all around the world, especially those in Asia who are such a vital part of the Manchester United community,” added Florence Lafaye, Commercial Director of the club.

The partnership is announced ahead of Manchester United’s English Premier League (EPL) match against Brentford FC, where Tiger Beer’s brand will be showcased for the first time in Old Trafford on LED boards within the famous stadium.
