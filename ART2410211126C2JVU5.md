The Philippines is the only Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean) member actively denouncing China’s illegal, coercive, aggressive, and deceptive actions in the South China Sea, according to a Philippine Coast Guard (PCG) official.

Commodore Jay Tarriela, the PCG spokesperson for the West Philippine Sea, said this in response to an opinion piece published in the Global Times claiming that “Manila is the only Asean member that deliberately turns a blind eye to Washington’s manipulation.”

“The Philippines stands as the sole ASEAN member actively denouncing China’s illegal, coercive, aggressive, and deceptive actions in the South China Sea,” Tarriela wrote on X.

“Our stance is not merely a fight for our rights in the West Philippine Sea; it reflects our commitment to upholding the rule of law, protecting the marine environment, and safeguarding the livelihoods of local fishermen. Beijing must cease its narrative that we are merely pawns of Washington,” he added.

Tarriela pointed out that PCG’s video evidence on Beijing’s aggression showed that “there is no evidence of US vessels” in the West Philippine Sea.

“For over a year, we have brought to light your barbaric and provocative actions, and in every photo and video we have released, there is no evidence of US vessels—only the Chinese Coast Guard, Chinese Maritime Militia, and PLA (People’s Liberation Army) Navy,” he argued.

“The hope that Asean will remain silent in the face of your actions that undermine the rule of law, harm the marine environment, and harass Filipino fishermen is misguided,” he concluded.

The opinion piece was in reaction to Defense Secretary Gilberto Teodoro Jr.’s October 14 remarks saying that he does not see “good faith” on the part of Beijing in the code of conduct (COC) negotiations.

Teodoro echoed President Ferdinand “Bongbong” Marcos Jr.’s call to all Asean members “not to turn a blind eye” to aggressors in the South China Sea.
